## 03/03/20 14:41 to 17:05, Working on WWW site.  +EQT

## 10/03/20 05:45 to 07:21, Working on memory book

## 10/03/20 14:15 to 15:53, Working on memory book 

## 11/03/20 06:26 to 08:44, Working on memory book. 
I've got 53 pages (75 sized for 6 by 9). There's going to be maybe five pages of diagrams, and another page of references. How much more have I got to write?      

Chapters
* Completely restructure the opening chapter, cut it down and make it reasonable. 
  * Do the list of what we want people to know and understand in the first chapter 
* The types chapter is acutally reasonable okay, might put more in as it grows, but otherwise happy to leave it for now until polish.   
* Linked list needs properly writing. There's nothing there 
* Arrays also isn't done. The structure exists but it's just chat.  
* Classes needs reformatting: a way of properly refering to classes and to have also really worked out a nice way of separating the image from the explanation 
* Trees needs some editing and the images, but the material is mostly there. I feel like it would benefit from some exercises. 

In general: 
* Look for definitions and key words: link, mnemonic and put them into the text 
  * As part of this work out how we refer to the process 'lock in' a memory??  
  * Rewrite the opennings to all chapters and start again. 



## 15/03/20 08:17 
I want to have 30,000 words at peak so I can edit down.  That looks like being a reasonable thing.    

Ways of increasing the page count: 

* Diagrams, a diagram for every image/link we have  
* Exercises -  a page of exercises at the end of every chapter 
* Introductions and conclusions "This chapter will, this chapter has"  
* Lists of examples 
* Pithy quotes form other people about usefulness 
* Put all the rubbish in the appendixes 

## 15/03/20 08:20 
One of the things that will help will be finding a nice way of typesetting the difference between images and the things they refer to.

## 07/09/20 09:19 to 09:49, Upgrading +EQT emails 
So right now I can send mail (to gmail) from joe@equalitytime.co.uk from G-suite -but the autoresponder goes to joeequalitytime@gmail (which should happen) 

However, the email "Test Monday" to joe@www goes to joeeqaulity@gmail which is not what I want and might be some problem with DNS propergation. 

## 07/09/20 09:49 to 10:03, +EQT
* I had planned to only move the www email accounts, but I've actually moved the eqt ones as well because I'd already created some eqt ones in Gsuite. 

## 07/09/20 10:03 to 10:39, +EQT
I've started the process of pointing the DNS records at the github pages site. It's sort of working, but there's a problem with the css?

* Also working out some next steps, as always
* Also wrote the webmasters question: https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/q/131325/14932 

## 08/09/20 09:12 to 09:20, More fixing notes, more getting on top of everything. +EQT
I like that this way of doing notes is working better. Like, there's a lot of work that happens when processing the notes and it's worth doing, particularly in concert with the internet files. 

## 08/09/20 09:21 to 09:33, Thinking about good ways of using log files

## 08/09/20 09:48 to 10:10, +EQT Timesheet broken

## 08/09/20 10:38 to 10:48, +EQT fixing WWW site 

## 09/09/20 07:23 to 07:38, Writing up notes 
Notes on notes: 
* I'm NOT taking enought. 

## 09/09/20 07:38 to 07:56, Thinking about notes 
* I want A place for them to be stored (that is backed up) 
* I want to write them locally first and then work up. 
* I'm tired. 
* Today I have to do the actual THINGs I'm meant to be doing. 
* But first, let me actually fix the THING.  

So where to put this? 
* It's one big file. I'd like to have it under version control MAYBE? Or MAYBE simply occsaionally backed up. It probably has to live on the server for the timesheet STUFF to work... 
* I could simply paste it into the timesheet... 
* I want it public because that's what I want. 
* It's effectively a weblog, so it goes on the personal site. That's the backup.   


## 09/09/20 07:38 to 07:56, Thinking about notes 
I've put the main log file in the blog for now. 
...and While I'm here, I'll treat myself to moving a post. 

## 09/09/20 07:56, So what's the next THING on the list. 
* Ah, a problem with doing it locally is that I don't have an easy way to reach the todo list. Let's see how we do.  

## 09/09/20 08:09 to 08:12, https://github.com/eQualityTime/Home/issues/105 
Sorting out minutes first 

## 09/09/20 08:46 to 09:18, Fixing minutes +EQT


## 10/09/20 07:07 to 07:50, Starting with Google analytics  
* Notes: Twitter isn't that healthy, particularly in terms of - unit-per-post. 
* fb is driving most of my links, despitre the fact that I hardly ever post links there. 
* Linkedin is doing suprisingly well, worth keeping going on that. 
* YouTube has it's own analtics, but it turns out you can put a GA code in there. 
* I haven't properly set up the analtics for the new WWW site. 

## 10/09/20 07:52 to 07:56, Writing up notes 

## 10/09/20 07:56 to 09:35, Email +EQT
* I've imported signitures and such. I will, in the future, work out mirgrating emails and contacts 
* I've imported contacts 
* I'm looking at importing all mail. 
  * I think I have to wait 24 hours for mail import.
* I have one email to write. 

## 10/09/20 10:20 to 10:30, +EQT
* I have two emails to write. 
  * One to the prison. Done
- 10/09/20 smallest next step:  I literally  have to read an email. 

Okay, the issue is that the SK and bg files don't convert well with OBF. I'd better convert them and see what happens. 


## 11/09/20 07:00 to 10:36, Working on WWW website 
* Wrote up the article 
* Spent a lot of time getting the allbooksever.csv right. 
* Fixed the jekyll issues 

Things left to do: 

* Odre the covers. 
* Push to server 
* Write blog post. 


## 11/09/20 19:48 to 20:16,  Photo editing. 
There where literally none I liked. 
* There is a ongoing problem with taking photos facing the sun. Lots of shady photos and overexposed backgrounds. 

## 12/09/20 17:10, What do I want for the office? 

* Another monitor (that's always what I want) 
* A better way of dealing with full screen STUFF.  
* A place for the water butt hat I can reach. 
* A 'outbox' 
* Clear out a few drawers. 
* A big TV for 'adult rec room'. 
* Place for brainstorming - big workspace. 
* The mac mini put up. 


What do I want 'to hand'?

* Taking a moment for the Joka reminders.


## 13/09/20 15:52 to 16:20, Logged into public 
* doing the admin of a new operating system
* This site https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubegaming/comments/64lprh/creating_stream_highlights_after_stream_ends/ has it that I can easily extract highlights from youtube while leaving the origianl video. Let's have a look. 
* Interestingly, you can't make changes for a few hours after you have, say, clipped a few seconds off the front. Does that mean that it's hard to take multiple highlights from one stream? 
* I haven't worked out highlights yet, but I did manage a tweet. 
* I've labeled a few streams 
* I've found the 'save as new' option, but it's a bit scary to use. I can imagine it being a problem. 
* Having reviewed a couple of streams, I think you have to think in terms of individual separate tasks and break them down. 

## 13/09/20 16:31 to 16:37,  Clearing out the filespace 
* Included commiting the memory book, but not pushing it before delete. Sigh. My own fault, obviously
* Now what? Check out the todo list? Crazy talk  
* Crap, the todo list is totally out of date. I've been not on top of things at all.

## 19/09/20 06:10 to 06:24, Reviewing presentations 
* Decided that they should be in a public dropbox folder because that's easist to edit later 
* Found at that most of them aren't interesting to look at.  

## 19/09/20 06:24 to 06:46, I'm working on updating my parlimentary tracker 
It's not been working for a while, and it turns out that's because my clever 'I'll get the data from everypolition, was a poor shout'. 

I've setup a new list of mps names, but now I have to read it. and I'd like to do some proper python testing while I'm there. 

## 19/09/20 08:20 to 09:08, More on Mps

## 21/09/20 07:38 to 09:50, Really attacked the personal todo list
I started with 34 items, but got to about 25. Included some DIY, phone calls, weeding out some doubles, that sort of thing. Was worthwhile.  Included reviewing my feedly feeds which was _just better_ than getting information from social media.

## 09/11/20 20:21 to 20:48, Working on Vision.

## 15/11/20 07:44 to 08:45, Doing cookery course. 
* Baking soda - if you have 'too much' baking soda to react with the acid, it's probably there to increase browning. 
* Sous vide doens't only cook meat precisely - it's got a characteristic 'edge to edge is the same level of done' rather than '25% of your stake is more done that one want it' 
* The old CTO of microsoft is really interesting. 
* Heat diffiusion constants all turn out to be between like 1.2 and 1.8, and that turns out to be because water has a constant of 1.4 so the L=root(4dt)=root(5.6t) is a good aproximation 
* Rule of thumb - 4 minutes to go one cm.  Now, if you have a six cm baked potatoe, then you  need, 16 minutes for two, and then an hour for four cm. 
* It would be interesting to compare with the set heating times for oven THINGs

Wasted a lot of time on it. 

## 17/12/20 10:56, Let's think about cookery processes. 
If I want to document cookery experiments then I also want to write them up. But, they are likely to be very multimedia, very link based, and should b e done reflectively.  That says blog to me. It also means  Ishould practice my food photography.

  * To the extent that they are edits to the blog, because they should be written properly. 
* I'm going to do a proper example now. 

## 18/12/20 11:09 to 11:30, Working on Sibs draft. 
This is quite hard, and they've written it in a much less positive way than I would phrase it. It's also directly linked to me as a person.  I have spoken to mum and shared it with her to check that she is okay with the general tone.

* I reconciled up to 31/10/2020 on 10/11/2020 
* That was the last date I uploaded any files according to the audit log. 
* The way I checked that I wouldn't import transactions multiple times was that I started the reconciliation and checked if any transactions turned up (this is probably good practice anyway. 
* I've reconcilled now. 
* Finding out how to sort bills. 
* Okay let me explain this. 

Okay Joe, next time you reconcile an account here's how you do it. 

* Get the paper copy. 
* Optional - tick off the bills (on paper) that should have been paid
* Start the reconciliation (it will fail), putting in the end date and ending balance.* If there are any transactions to sort out, they should appear, but in general, there shouldn't be any tranactions to reconcile. 
* Download the month's figures from Unity and import. Remember to select format before the statment name
* As you import, tick off the amounts on the bank statement. Make sure that anything that should be a bill, is matched to one. 
* IMPORTANT - double check the bills list and make sure the right THINGs have gone out.
* Complete reconciliation. 

I've added these instructions to the calendar

## 24/12/20 13:20 to 13:30, Working on Mouse Sniper 

For my own personal amusement I try to use the mouse as little as possible during the working day.  You could, I suppose, make the argument that it's more efficient to do everything by keyboard shortcut, and I suppose it is, but it's far less of an efficiency gain than a hundred other things I could do. 

I approach this quite sportingly. I use [whatpulse](XXX) to keep track of the ratio of keystokes to mouseclicks over time, and spend a certain amount of fascinated time looking up obscure shortcut keys of all types.  

Professionally, I do also have a general interest in keyboard control of devices from a accessibility perspective, but I should be clear that my main motivation is a general playfulness (I won't deny that it's useful to have a good working knowledge of what sites and organisations are good for accessibility, and it feels good to support them) 
With this motivation, I'm put together a short Python script recently that lets me quickly arrange mouse clicks via the keyboard.  It was a nice little project for the Christmas break.   

## 25/12/20 11:09, (and various other times) Working on Mouse Sniper 
* Got the cropping working so it's a bit faster

## 26/12/20 20:10 to 22:05, Working on Mouse-sniper
* I think the solution to a hotkey is to use automator, which is a shame for sharing, but still quite fun. 


## 27/12/20 07:54, Hmm, the whatpulse thing is slighlty annoying, The loca 
The logical solution is to add a count in my mouse snipe, but that feels like a lot of work for software I'd like to be more broadly used. 

It's also far too early to put it in - as it gets easier to use, it will get used more, and once it's at the point of being used properly then it will start aquiring click

Alright people, let's do this one last time. My name is Joe Reddington. I was a postdoc and then I was bitten by a radioactive nonprofit. And for the last seven years I've been running the one and only eQuality Time. 

I'm pretty sure you know the rest.  You see I won some grants, lost a lot more, fell in love, worked with a lot of schools, MAYBE too many. Wrote code, worked with researchers, worked without researchers. Made art. Tried therapy, started massively oversharing, had kids, found out about the lockdown while in literal prison FFS, and waved goodbye to our income for 2020, I'm now finding a way back. 

## 13/01/21 20:04, Still here.

## 18/01/21 09:06 to 09:16, (A) Ring jewelers about return dates

## 18/01/21 09:18,(B) 60 1 hour SimpleWriter on book  
Seems fair.  

## 18/01/21 09:19, The main question is: where did I get to? 

## 18/01/21 09:21 to 09:40, Hey, you know what, I really want to have a version of simplewriter for vim, which is surely achieveable by switching the dictionary locaiton... 


## 18/01/21 09:40 to 10:12, Writing up notes as a blog post 

## 18/01/21 10:13, It's NOT done done until I sort the vimrc

## 18/01/21 10:28 to 10:39, Phone call from mother 

## 18/01/21 10:39 to 11:36, (B) 60 1 hour SimpleWriter on book  
* Starting to wonder if I need another dictionary with more common words 
* Added a citation when I borrowed a line, that's probably overkill. 
* Got to line 381, feels like I'm really slow. But made it to the second chapter at least  
* I'm thinking that I shouldn't simplify the language in the imagry, but I should simplify the structure

## 18/01/21 11:37 to 11:55, Fixing a bug in the simplewriter 




## 18/01/21 13:15 to 15:00, At Lyle's Crucible
The link is: http://bit.ly/cruciblemiro 

Currently watching the vidoes


## 18/01/21 19:55 to 20:17, Looking at Google Search Console and creating a site map. 
I've submitted the sitemap but will have to look into it later. 
Sitemap url is https://joereddington.github.io/sitemap.xml 

## 18/01/21 20:38, Working on list gently


## 19/01/21 06:39, Emails. 
* Still getting the sitemap error 

## 19/01/21 07:42, Big job for today is the fore applicaiton 

## 19/01/21 09:44 to 11:42, Drafting an application to the fore +EQT
Next action is to:

* Put the finance information in
* Email the trustees 

## 20/01/21 07:22 to 08:27, Working on the fore application  +EQT 
Sent the email - the numbers turned out to be a pain. 

## 20/01/21 08:40, Okay, now what? 

## 21/01/21 06:47 to 06:49, Distraction. 

## 21/01/21 06:49, Processing Calendar.  



## 21/01/21 07:01 to 07:30, Writing decent sized email to the media trust. +EQT 

Then some faffing around in vim. 

## 21/01/21 08:16, 
I'm going to review the google doc from yesterday

## 21/01/21 08:22 to 08:40,  Working on the Fake People Fake News +EQT 

## 21/01/21 09:00 to 10:31, Meeting with fake news people +EQT 

## 21/01/21 11:32 to 11:53, time for gratidute. 

## 21/01/21 13:37 to 13:45, Writing my Nova routine. 

## 22/01/21 13:45 to 14:28, Turning Mouse-Sniper into an app. 
* All details at today's blog 

## 22/01/21 14:28 to 14:45, Writing/pushing the blog
* Also learned how to reference an internal blog 


## 22/01/21 08:45, Working on the Fore Grant again. +EQT
* This is a useful url: https://drive.google.com/drive/recent
* I've processed the changes from my reviewer
* Adding pictures.  
* Send to FB 

## 25/01/21 07:47 to 07:59, Submitting the Fore grant files.  +EQT 
* Trustee has reviewed, I understand we only have to submit. 
* Getting the link from email took ages, This would have been solved if I'd done a github issue properly. 

## 25/01/21 07:15, 
The next THING to do with Mousesniper is to get it to do drags. So I want a system where I store a click, and then hold it down. 

Add a keybinding (I like times) that flipped a boolean and stored an x/y
Change the click so that they check the boolean (and slowly move) 


## 25/01/21 09:10 to 0942, Learning about vimdiff
What did I learn? 

That using vimdiff in git opens four  windows, and the easiest way to process is to close the middle one and concentrate on getting the top two in sync. 

If there is a time the top two aren't in sync, check it with the bottom one .

Also, I'd really really like to be able to sort entires by time. 





## 25/01/21 10:05 to 10:08, Checking sitemap on joereddington.github.com
There was a problem that the sitemap was only using 'example.com' generated urls. 
I've fixed it and put in a new version. 
It took six days to read the sitemap, so I'm going to put in a note to check next Tuesday 


## 25/01/21 11:08 to 11:58, Meeting and updating tracking code +EQT
Nice chat and then spent some time adding conversion code to the website - I choose emails as a conversion metric, but I should probably have chosen 'contact us' as an option. 

Later edit: conversion code did actually work

## 26/01/21 09:12 to 09:23, Checking sitemap
Hey! 48 found urls!  
But they aren't listed on coverage. Maybe best to wait some more. 

## 26/01/21 09:23 to 09:40, 
Having some small thinking about markdown images now that I know some vimscript. 

Steps are: 
* Take the image
* Copy the image to a local folder and insert the text. 
* Really what I want is an abrevation that let's me grab a filetype 

I [asked a question on vim stack exchange](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/28906/how-do-i-get-filename-completion-to-ignore-a-leading), and the reply was broadly "no", but pointed out some options in Jekyll

Vim issue  was fixed later when tidying up. 


## 26/01/21 09:44 to 10:08, Emails, including time playing with thunderbird.
* [Here's the list of of shortcuts](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/keyboard-shortcuts) 
* The reason there was a problem with sending mail was that I hadn't opened the 'sent mail' folder on gmail.  I imagine it will work on my laptop again now.  
	* Update, it's going to be annoying syncing the settings between devices. 



## 26/01/21 10:08 to 11:30, +EQT emails
I lost some content from yesterday, this is best guess for +EQT emails (I definitely had a break in the middle)


## 27/01/21 07:38 to 08:00, Been sorting out signitures FOR 20 MINUTES! 
## 27/01/21 08:02 to 08:15, Personal Emails now. 

## 27/01/21 08:15 to 09:17, +EQT emails now 
A lot of that was on the Google Ads. 
And the rest of was writing follow up emails from the Crucible.

## 27/01/21 13:21 to 13:51, Tidying this file 
...and checking sitemap
* Checking Sitemap, we've gone up to 29 valid files. (but there are 38 posts so...)* Ah, it lists 20 files that have been discovered and are waiting to be indexed. That's a start.   
* Also Reviewed the inserting of images into this file. I've updated the approach and I'm happy with it. Got it closer to 2 minutes, which still feels very long. 



## 27/01/21 13:52 to 14:25, I want to think more about this inserting of images idea. 
I think I've solved the 'write markdown to insert the image' problem, but I don't believe I've fixed the 'get file into the right place, ideally without a mouse' problem. 

This was interesting to build. I couldn't get it to call the function I'd created (although I could get the function to run independently) 

	:command! -nargs=+ -complete=file Joe Insertimage(<f-args>) 


I think the most simple way will be to drag and use the abbreviation. Let it bed in. 

## 27/01/21 14:28, In any case, I should probably do some light blogging. 



## 28/01/21 05:46 to 05:56, faffing for 10 minutes
## 28/01/21 05:57 to 05:58, Time to look at the actions from last week. +EQT 
Turns out I'm on top of that one. 

Are we at 'go public? I think we are...
