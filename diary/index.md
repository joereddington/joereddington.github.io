## 03/03/20 14:41 to 17:05, Working on WWW site.  +EQT

## 10/03/20 05:45 to 07:21, Working on memory book

## 10/03/20 14:15 to 15:53, Working on memory book 

## 11/03/20 06:26 to 08:44, Working on memory book. 
I've got 53 pages (75 sized for 6 by 9). There's going to be maybe five pages of diagrams, and another page of references. How much more have I got to write?      

Chapters
* Completely restructure the opening chapter, cut it down and make it reasonable. 
  * Do the list of what we want people to know and understand in the first chapter 
* The types chapter is acutally reasonable okay, might put more in as it grows, but otherwise happy to leave it for now until polish.   
* Linked list needs properly writing. There's nothing there 
* Arrays also isn't done. The structure exists but it's just chat.  
* Classes needs reformatting: a way of properly refering to classes and to have also really worked out a nice way of separating the image from the explanation 
* Trees needs some editing and the images, but the material is mostly there. I feel like it would benefit from some exercises. 

In general: 
* Look for definitions and key words: link, mnemonic and put them into the text 
  * As part of this work out how we refer to the process 'lock in' a memory??  
  * Rewrite the opennings to all chapters and start again. 



## 15/03/20 08:17 
I want to have 30,000 words at peak so I can edit down.  That looks like being a reasonable thing.    

Ways of increasing the page count: 

* Diagrams, a diagram for every image/link we have  
* Exercises -  a page of exercises at the end of every chapter 
* Introductions and conclusions "This chapter will, this chapter has"  
* Lists of examples 
* Pithy quotes form other people about usefulness 
* Put all the rubbish in the appendixes 

## 15/03/20 08:20 
One of the things that will help will be finding a nice way of typesetting the difference between images and the things they refer to.

## 07/09/20 09:19 to 09:49, Upgrading +EQT emails 
So right now I can send mail (to gmail) from joe@equalitytime.co.uk from G-suite -but the autoresponder goes to joeequalitytime@gmail (which should happen) 

However, the email "Test Monday" to joe@www goes to joeeqaulity@gmail which is not what I want and might be some problem with DNS propergation. 

## 07/09/20 09:49 to 10:03, +EQT
* I had planned to only move the www email accounts, but I've actually moved the eqt ones as well because I'd already created some eqt ones in Gsuite. 

## 07/09/20 10:03 to 10:39, +EQT
I've started the process of pointing the DNS records at the github pages site. It's sort of working, but there's a problem with the css?

* Also working out some next steps, as always
* Also wrote the webmasters question: https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/q/131325/14932 

## 08/09/20 09:12 to 09:20, More fixing notes, more getting on top of everything. +EQT
I like that this way of doing notes is working better. Like, there's a lot of work that happens when processing the notes and it's worth doing, particularly in concert with the internet files. 

## 08/09/20 09:21 to 09:33, Thinking about good ways of using log files

## 08/09/20 09:48 to 10:10, +EQT Timesheet broken

## 08/09/20 10:38 to 10:48, +EQT fixing WWW site 

## 09/09/20 07:23 to 07:38, Writing up notes 
Notes on notes: 
* I'm NOT taking enought. 

## 09/09/20 07:38 to 07:56, Thinking about notes 
* I want A place for them to be stored (that is backed up) 
* I want to write them locally first and then work up. 
* I'm tired. 
* Today I have to do the actual THINGs I'm meant to be doing. 
* But first, let me actually fix the THING.  

So where to put this? 
* It's one big file. I'd like to have it under version control MAYBE? Or MAYBE simply occsaionally backed up. It probably has to live on the server for the timesheet STUFF to work... 
* I could simply paste it into the timesheet... 
* I want it public because that's what I want. 
* It's effectively a weblog, so it goes on the personal site. That's the backup.   


## 09/09/20 07:38 to 07:56, Thinking about notes 
I've put the main log file in the blog for now. 
...and While I'm here, I'll treat myself to moving a post. 

## 09/09/20 07:56, So what's the next THING on the list. 
* Ah, a problem with doing it locally is that I don't have an easy way to reach the todo list. Let's see how we do.  

## 09/09/20 08:09 to 08:12, https://github.com/eQualityTime/Home/issues/105 
Sorting out minutes first 

## 09/09/20 08:46 to 09:18, Fixing minutes +EQT


## 10/09/20 07:07 to 07:50, Starting with Google analytics  
* Notes: Twitter isn't that healthy, particularly in terms of - unit-per-post. 
* fb is driving most of my links, despitre the fact that I hardly ever post links there. 
* Linkedin is doing suprisingly well, worth keeping going on that. 
* YouTube has it's own analtics, but it turns out you can put a GA code in there. 
* I haven't properly set up the analtics for the new WWW site. 

## 10/09/20 07:52 to 07:56, Writing up notes 

## 10/09/20 07:56 to 09:35, Email +EQT
* I've imported signitures and such. I will, in the future, work out mirgrating emails and contacts 
* I've imported contacts 
* I'm looking at importing all mail. 
  * I think I have to wait 24 hours for mail import.
* I have one email to write. 

## 10/09/20 10:20 to 10:30, +EQT
* I have two emails to write. 
  * One to the prison. Done
- 10/09/20 smallest next step:  I literally  have to read an email. 

Okay, the issue is that the SK and bg files don't convert well with OBF. I'd better convert them and see what happens. 


## 11/09/20 07:00 to 10:36, Working on WWW website 
* Wrote up the article 
* Spent a lot of time getting the allbooksever.csv right. 
* Fixed the jekyll issues 

Things left to do: 

* Odre the covers. 
* Push to server 
* Write blog post. 


## 11/09/20 19:48 to 20:16,  Photo editing. 
There where literally none I liked. 
* There is a ongoing problem with taking photos facing the sun. Lots of shady photos and overexposed backgrounds. 

## 12/09/20 17:10, What do I want for the office? 

* Another monitor (that's always what I want) 
* A better way of dealing with full screen STUFF.  
* A place for the water butt hat I can reach. 
* A 'outbox' 
* Clear out a few drawers. 
* A big TV for 'adult rec room'. 
* Place for brainstorming - big workspace. 
* The mac mini put up. 


What do I want 'to hand'?

* Taking a moment for the Joka reminders.


## 13/09/20 15:52 to 16:20, Logged into public 
* doing the admin of a new operating system
* This site https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubegaming/comments/64lprh/creating_stream_highlights_after_stream_ends/ has it that I can easily extract highlights from youtube while leaving the origianl video. Let's have a look. 
* Interestingly, you can't make changes for a few hours after you have, say, clipped a few seconds off the front. Does that mean that it's hard to take multiple highlights from one stream? 
* I haven't worked out highlights yet, but I did manage a tweet. 
* I've labeled a few streams 
* I've found the 'save as new' option, but it's a bit scary to use. I can imagine it being a problem. 
* Having reviewed a couple of streams, I think you have to think in terms of individual separate tasks and break them down. 

## 13/09/20 16:31 to 16:37,  Clearing out the filespace 
* Included commiting the memory book, but not pushing it before delete. Sigh. My own fault, obviously
* Now what? Check out the todo list? Crazy talk  
* Crap, the todo list is totally out of date. I've been not on top of things at all.

## 19/09/20 06:10 to 06:24, Reviewing presentations 
* Decided that they should be in a public dropbox folder because that's easist to edit later 
* Found at that most of them aren't interesting to look at.  

## 19/09/20 06:24 to 06:46, I'm working on updating my parlimentary tracker 
It's not been working for a while, and it turns out that's because my clever 'I'll get the data from everypolition, was a poor shout'. 

I've setup a new list of mps names, but now I have to read it. and I'd like to do some proper python testing while I'm there. 

## 19/09/20 08:20 to 09:08, More on Mps

## 21/09/20 07:38 to 09:50, Really attacked the personal todo list
I started with 34 items, but got to about 25. Included some DIY, phone calls, weeding out some doubles, that sort of thing. Was worthwhile.  Included reviewing my feedly feeds which was _just better_ than getting information from social media.

## 09/11/20 20:21 to 20:48, Working on Vision.

## 15/11/20 07:44 to 08:45, Doing cookery course. 
* Baking soda - if you have 'too much' baking soda to react with the acid, it's probably there to increase browning. 
* Sous vide doens't only cook meat precisely - it's got a characteristic 'edge to edge is the same level of done' rather than '25% of your stake is more done that one want it' 
* The old CTO of microsoft is really interesting. 
* Heat diffiusion constants all turn out to be between like 1.2 and 1.8, and that turns out to be because water has a constant of 1.4 so the L=root(4dt)=root(5.6t) is a good aproximation 
* Rule of thumb - 4 minutes to go one cm.  Now, if you have a six cm baked potatoe, then you  need, 16 minutes for two, and then an hour for four cm. 
* It would be interesting to compare with the set heating times for oven THINGs

Wasted a lot of time on it. 

## 17/12/20 10:56, Let's think about cookery processes. 
If I want to document cookery experiments then I also want to write them up. But, they are likely to be very multimedia, very link based, and should b e done reflectively.  That says blog to me. It also means  Ishould practice my food photography. 


## 18/12/20 09:18 to 09:23, Setting up email properly on Thunderbird.

* I'm going to do a proper example now. 

## 18/12/20 11:09 to 11:30, Working on Sibs draft. 
This is quite hard, and they've written it in a much less positive way than I would phrase it. It's also directly linked to me as a person.  I have spoken to mum and shared it with her to check that she is okay with the general tone.

* I reconciled up to 31/10/2020 on 10/11/2020 
* That was the last date I uploaded any files according to the audit log. 
* The way I checked that I wouldn't import transactions multiple times was that I started the reconciliation and checked if any transactions turned up (this is probably good practice anyway. 
* I've reconcilled now. 
* Finding out how to sort bills. 
* Okay let me explain this. 

Okay Joe, next time you reconcile an account here's how you do it. 

* Get the paper copy. 
* Optional - tick off the bills (on paper) that should have been paid
* Start the reconciliation (it will fail), putting in the end date and ending balance.* If there are any transactions to sort out, they should appear, but in general, there shouldn't be any tranactions to reconcile. 
* Download the month's figures from Unity and import. Remember to select format before the statment name
* As you import, tick off the amounts on the bank statement. Make sure that anything that should be a bill, is matched to one. 
* IMPORTANT - double check the bills list and make sure the right THINGs have gone out.
* Complete reconciliation. 

I've added these instructions to the calendar

* We have showing of an image, 
* We're currently installing the screenshot library (took ages) 
* I don't know if we'll ever have a system shortcut

* Lots of rewriting 
* Put it at https://github.com/joereddington/Mouse-Sniper/tree/main and the next action is to write the blog 


## 24/12/20 13:20 to 13:30, Working on Mouse Sniper 

For my own personal amusement I try to use the mouse as little as possible during the working day.  You could, I suppose, make the argument that it's more efficient to do everything by keyboard shortcut, and I suppose it is, but it's far less of an efficiency gain than a hundred other things I could do. 

I approach this quite sportingly. I use [whatpulse](XXX) to keep track of the ratio of keystokes to mouseclicks over time, and spend a certain amount of fascinated time looking up obscure shortcut keys of all types.  

Professionally, I do also have a general interest in keyboard control of devices from a accessibility perspective, but I should be clear that my main motivation is a general playfulness (I won't deny that it's useful to have a good working knowledge of what sites and organisations are good for accessibility, and it feels good to support them) 
With this motivation, I'm put together a short Python script recently that lets me quickly arrange mouse clicks via the keyboard.  It was a nice little project for the Christmas break.   

## 25/12/20 11:09, (and various other times) Working on Mouse Sniper 
* Got the cropping working so it's a bit faster

* Also changing nappies, that sort of thing
* Blog written up here:  http://127.0.0.1:4000/2020/12/26/mouse-sniper.html 

## 26/12/20 20:10 to 22:05, Working on Mouse-sniper
* I think the solution to a hotkey is to use automator, which is a shame for sharing, but still quite fun. 


## 27/12/20 07:54, Hmm, the whatpulse thing is slighlty annoying, The loca 
The logical solution is to add a count in my mouse snipe, but that feels like a lot of work for software I'd like to be more broadly used. 

It's also far too early to put it in - as it gets easier to use, it will get used more, and once it's at the point of being used properly then it will start aquiring click

## 29/12/20 06:38, Dragging is going to be hard with the mouse sniper, unless I `store` the first click and then have it execute slowly. 
* That does actually sound like a solution



## 29/12/20 09:01 to 10:28, Doing simplewriter on book

## 29/12/20 10:28, P20 I have reached 'contributions' - that's actually a solid 90 minutes, time to do something else.  

## 29/12/20 10:34, Okay, I'm looking at my list.  I've onde at least the firsto ne.

Alright people, let's do this one last time. My name is Joe Reddington. I was a postdoc and then I was bitten by a radioactive nonprofit. And for the last seven years I've been running the one and only eQuality Time. 

I'm pretty sure you know the rest.  You see I won some grants, lost a lot more, fell in love, worked with a lot of schools, MAYBE too many. Wrote code, worked with researchers, worked without researchers. Made art. Tried therapy, started massively oversharing, had kids, found out about the lockdown while in literal prison FFS, and waved goodbye to our income for 2020, I'm now finding a way back.

Seems fair.  

## 18/01/21 09:19, The main question is: where did I get to? 

## 18/01/21 09:21 to 09:40, Hey, you know what, I really want to have a version of simplewriter for vim, which is surely achieveable by switching the dictionary locaiton...

* Added a citation when I borrowed a line, that's probably overkill. 
* Got to line 381, feels like I'm really slow. But made it to the second chapter at least  
* I'm thinking that I shouldn't simplify the language in the imagry, but I should simplify the structure

Sent the email - the numbers turned out to be a pain.

## 25/01/21 07:15, 
The next THING to do with Mousesniper is to get it to do drags. So I want a system where I store a click, and then hold it down. 

Add a keybinding (I like times) that flipped a boolean and stored an x/y
Change the click so that they check the boolean (and slowly move) 

## 25/01/21 08:34 to 08:39, Doing some light email +EQT 

## 25/01/21 09:10 to 09:42, Learning about vimdiff
What did I learn? 

That using vimdiff in git with the command 'git mergetool' opens four  windows, and the easiest way to process is to close the middle one and concentrate on getting the top two in sync. 

If there is a time the top two aren't in sync, check it with the bottom one .

Also, I'd really really like to be able to sort entires by time. 





## 25/01/21 10:05 to 10:08, Checking sitemap on joereddington.github.com
There was a problem that the sitemap was only using 'example.com' generated urls. 
I've fixed it and put in a new version. 
It took six days to read the sitemap, so I'm going to put in a note to check next Tuesday 


## 25/01/21 11:08 to 11:58, Meeting and updating tracking code +EQT
Nice chat and then spent some time adding conversion code to the website - I choose emails as a conversion metric, but I should probably have chosen 'contact us' as an option. 

Later edit: conversion code did actually work

## 26/01/21 09:12 to 09:23, Checking sitemap
Hey! 48 found urls!  
But they aren't listed on coverage. Maybe best to wait some more. 

## 26/01/21 09:23 to 09:40, 
Having some small thinking about markdown images now that I know some vimscript. 

Steps are: 
* Take the image
* Copy the image to a local folder and insert the text. 
* Really what I want is an abrevation that let's me grab a filetype 

I [asked a question on vim stack exchange](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/28906/how-do-i-get-filename-completion-to-ignore-a-leading), and the reply was broadly "no", but pointed out some options in Jekyll

Vim issue  was fixed later when tidying up. 


## 26/01/21 09:44 to 10:08, Emails, including time playing with thunderbird.
* [Here's the list of of shortcuts](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/keyboard-shortcuts) 
* The reason there was a problem with sending mail was that I hadn't opened the 'sent mail' folder on gmail.  I imagine it will work on my laptop again now.  
	* Update, it's going to be annoying syncing the settings between devices. 



## 26/01/21 10:08 to 11:30, +EQT emails
I lost some content from yesterday, this is best guess for +EQT emails (I definitely had a break in the middle)


## 27/01/21 07:38 to 08:00, Been sorting out signitures FOR 20 MINUTES! 
## 27/01/21 08:02 to 08:15, Personal Emails now. 

## 27/01/21 08:15 to 09:17, +EQT emails now 
A lot of that was on the Google Ads. 
And the rest of was writing follow up emails from the Crucible.

## 27/01/21 13:21 to 13:51, Tidying this file 
...and checking sitemap
* Checking Sitemap, we've gone up to 29 valid files. (but there are 38 posts so...)* Ah, it lists 20 files that have been discovered and are waiting to be indexed. That's a start.   
* Also Reviewed the inserting of images into this file. I've updated the approach and I'm happy with it. Got it closer to 2 minutes, which still feels very long. 



## 27/01/21 13:52 to 14:25, I want to think more about this inserting of images idea. 
I think I've solved the 'write markdown to insert the image' problem, but I don't believe I've fixed the 'get file into the right place, ideally without a mouse' problem. 

This was interesting to build. I couldn't get it to call the function I'd created (although I could get the function to run independently) 

	:command! -nargs=+ -complete=file Joe Insertimage(<f-args>) 


I think the most simple way will be to drag and use the abbreviation. Let it bed in. 

## 27/01/21 14:28, In any case, I should probably do some light blogging. 



## 28/01/21 05:46 to 05:56, faffing for 10 minutes
## 28/01/21 05:57 to 05:58, Time to look at the actions from last week. +EQT 
Turns out I'm on top of that one.

## 06/02/21 13:41 to 14:01, Intergrating Watson into homepage
* First action is to learn about submodules
	* Commiting the main (super) project, says "The superproject is linked to the current commit of the subproject" so when updating, you pull the subproject, then commit the superproject.
	* It is possible to merge files back in and preserve history

	Git 2.23 (Q3 2019): if you want to clone and update the submodules to their latest revision:

	git clone --recurse-submodules --remote-submodules

	If you just want to clone them at their recorded SHA1:

	git clone --recurse-submodules


	git submodule init
	git submodule update
* I checked watson online - there was nothing to push
* I added the submodule to my homepage with the following command
     git submodule add -b dr_wat https://github.com/joereddington/watson/ diary/watson

* I ran ./watson ../index.md and it failed. 
* I ran tests, they worked, I created a new one for index.md 
* As a distraction, I found out that I could make tag files with 

    ctags *.py

* I cut down the example, and wrote some simplifying test cases. 
* While simplifying I came accross another simple error - the Entry class didn't check it was being passed a string. I fixed it, and created a test to check. 
   * In the process, I learned the python for testing an exception is thrown. 
* Oddly, I couldn't get the bug to trigger when I imported the code directly. 
Well that's strange, it works fine when I don't use get content... 
* I continued drilling down, I found some print statements that suggested I'd tried this before. 
* I tried altering the function, but other tests failed (this was the second time other tests had caught a problem), eventually I made the constructor ensure that there was always a valid for entry.end 
* I (finally) managed a sucessful rebase - by putting the reword at the top and the squashes below it. 
* After all that, the code is working as I hoped it already was.

## 12/02/21 07:28 to 08:07, Fixing joereddington.github.io
That was interesting. 
* It's still unclear where the error was, I think it might have been a combination of a problem with a missing image in index.md and a seperate problem with the submodule I added. 
* I used the "git revert HEAD" command to 'reverse' the last commit (it appends an extra on on the end) and later I used the command "git revert X" to reverse only commit X. That was awesome. 
* In the end I created a new main branch with only the commits on it that I liked. That was fun. 
* I used the "git cherry-pick c096635" command, which let me grab a single commit from another branch and bang it on the end
* I'd be willing to try the submodule again. 

## 12/02/21 08:14 to 08:22, 
* I thought this was interesting:  https://www.matuzo.at/blog/testing-with-tab/ in the context of keyboard only usage of websites.   
I've generally been faffing though. It's really time for some good gratitude posting!

## 29/01/21 08:17, Accounts section
* 171 pages? That's cool. I really though we'd drop 20 in this process.  I'm up to 111 of this review as well (although I think there is a lot more work now) 
* Fixed an early bug  
* I've fixed the next table Now I need another one beause I have to do the major system THING  
* We'll do the index when we come to that bit of the pdf 

- 29/01/21 smallest next step:  generate the major system keywords for the accounts and keep writing  


## 29/01/21 14:17 to 15:21, More book. 
Started by dealing with the footnotes
We're accdientally 175 pages! 
Now to commit


## 29/01/21 19:39 to 20:18, Back again.  
- 29/01/21 smallest next step:  Rewriting the Accounts example from the start. 
* Going to go through looking for caption/lable order problems 
* Also going through looking for undefined references 
* In future will need to sort citations.
* Back to rewriting. 


## 29/01/21 20:32 to 21:17,Book  
* I'm rewriting the accounts example 
* The class examples need two clear blank lines between them 
* Something has gone wrong with spelling :( 
- 29/01/21 smallest next step:  do work on summary, need to make sure those bits are in the main chapter

## 30/01/21 12:53 to 13:24, Book. Working on summary  
Working on the bullet point lines. I decided to go with all captials, all full stops (unless they are sentence fragments or word lists and to hell with the colon for the start
\(^.\{12}\d\d:\d\d\).*, is apparently the search I'm using but I think it's 

/\\item.*[^.]$ to find all the lines without full stops.  

## 30/01/21 14:56 to 15:41, Book again
* Done the bullets 
* Completed classes entirely 
* Rewrote the start of Trees 

We should note - there might be so much to rewrite from this point forward that it would be worth doing another simplewriter from the Trees Chapter onwards.

## 30/01/21 19:33, Back again

## 30/01/21 19:34, Oh wow - I wrote most of the tree chapter before the class chapter and it really shows. I've changed a lot of the terms and methods. 

## 30/01/21 19:51, I think I need to build this example properly. 

## 30/01/21 20:00, Okay, it's very simple to do with with three people per node, and then having external links. 


But it's two people per node. 

I need each of the people to be linked to a country, and be linked to another countiry. 

## 30/01/21 20:01, Let's do it myself. 

Couples. No, film antagonists. I have them murder a character from a previosu film 

France beat croatia \link Da Vinci Code, tom hanks is made of bagets and the monk is very proud of his cravat 

## 31/01/21 13:04 to 14:29, I'm back. Let's try this from the top. 
* Learning about Cntl-O in vim insert mode, it's quite the key saver
* Started a major rewrite, almost from scratch, of the first example in the tree chapter. I feel like I'm going to be here for a while.  

I think I want a bit of a break, but what's the next action. 

Next action is start again with the wriing at line 2010. This one is a slog.  


## 01/02/21 06:50, 
Ten thousand facebook hits feels like a lot. A lot.  

## 01/02/21 07:17 to 08:01, Delores
* Now doing the notebooks and the reminders
* Hey, found some urgent STUFF. 
* Now notebook, which was empty. Cool 

## 01/02/21 08:12 to 11:34, today I'd like to do a 'washington run through' which means I touch every time before I stop at... 11:30.  
* Didn't manage it, but did a really solid morning of ticking bits off. Lots got moved forward, lots got done, lots of STUFF got dumped. 



## 12/02/21 20:38 to 21:23, Memory book. 
It's been almost two weeks since I worked on this. Going to have to probably start from the start of the tree chapter again

Just rewriting from the start 

## 12/02/21 21:23, 
This chapter is hard. Make it more honest: 
I don't use this for family trees, and I suggest you don't because I don't know which of these are siblings, but I can make a point about balanced trees.  
  

## 16/02/21 08:01 to 08:50, Email day! 

## 16/02/21 08:54 to 09:25, Sorted out a review system. It was silly.

## 19/02/21 05:13 to 05:28, Clearing out Personal Inbox 
## 19/02/21 05:28 to 05:57, Now clearing out work inbox. 

## 19/02/21 05:57 to 06:30, working on this file. 
Which involved: 
* Deciding to write a blog post 
  * Wanting to change the colours on an ssh 
    * Downloading a new terminal app. 
Sigh. 

## 19/02/21 08:22 to 08:55, Live working on book.
I believe I've solved the first example.  
I'm still missing a couple of good examples, particularly around sorting. I might do years.  
Years of books?  Create a tree with the years that fictional books are set in. What is the point? Simple to construct, relatively easy to write out a list of 'nearby' dates (split long books into several parts)
* Disadvantaces (hard to search by film, hard to check something is already in (no it isn't!)   
* Oh, means that you can keep adding questions. 
* Walking the path is good context. 
* Can include biographies, films, and some history books. 
Yes, I think this might be a goer. 

I've done the big thinking. 
I want an example that is 'years of historical fiction books' 
I want an example that is 'inventions arranged in a tree' (subclasses still work) 

That gives me two more examples for a: 

* Introduction example 
* Sorting example
	* Invention sorting example. 
* Decision Tree example 

That's probably enough. 




## 19/02/21 10:19 to 10:27, Clearing up my git repos
* You can use 'git stash clear' to clear stashes  
* I've also been setting upstreams and STUFFj k:w
* Okay, the git is all nicely organised, that's nice. 

I would be nice to do some Mouse Sniper work. That starts by putting the mouse in the box and finding the first THING I have a problem with. 


## 19/02/21 10:35 to 11:12, (E) Write a python script for 'commands in this time window'
19/02/21 10:35, git clone http://github.com/joereddington/watson
19/02/21 10:58, pip3 install icalendar
* Converted to python3
* SE pointed out that I should read the .bash_history rather than the output of the history command.  
* Had the wrong branch for a while and tests were failing.
This might be a nice way of doing this. 

## 19/02/21 14:10 to 14:59, Working on the new watson 
I've discovered the annoying fact that this WON'T work on public because I didn't set up the history problems 

## 20/02/21 16:14 to 16:26, Working on vim command history

## 21/02/21 06:38 to 07:12, I'm working on the vim command history
Commands of interest:
21/02/21 06:48, python3 command_list.py "## 21/02/21 06:37 to 07:32,  Worki"
21/02/21 06:51, vim command_list.py

Actions: 
* I've updated the local vim to match master and added a missing plugin
* I've added the ability to be called from the command line to python
* I've run HISTTIMEFORMAT="%d/%m/%y %T " and that appeared to have had an effect on the laptop. 
* I've found out that history doesn't include repeated commands 
* I used  r !python3 git/watson/command_list.py "## 21/02/21 06:37 to 07:32,  Worki" which worked from the command line. 
* I've found out that the ": is the expression register
* I've written the lnc command which inserts the commands relabily, but it's using hardcoded data (and currently whipes the clipboard.


## 21/02/21 07:12 to 07:21, Updating this file 
* Rewrote the notes 
* Added the register use to lnc

## 28/02/21 07:31 to 08:26, Flowers for Turing site. +EQT
I was happy to find that I'd already made a site, also that some of the images weren't on the wordpress site at all - they were linking to old images from my CS website- that would have been sad to lose. 

I installed Jekyll from https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ - it gets easier every time.

I decided to make the existing content into blog posts. They are events that happen on a date.  I moved over the 2013 post (which is probably the longest and most complicated) and the FAQ 


Started using some cool commands to copy accross images 

wget -i `wget -qO- http://www.flowersforturing.equalitytime.co.uk/?page_id=3903 | sed -n '/<img/s/.*src="\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p' | awk '{gsub("thumb-350-", "");print}'`

That one was quite cool, I'll be using that again for the other pages.   

It needs maybe another hour, two, to move accross the rest of the pages and so on. Then I ask for proofreadin.


## 01/03/21 07:30 to 08:15, Tidying this file. 
So much faff, using tools that are actually meant to help. 

## 01/03/21 08:15, Okay, MAYBE now we can get started? 

No, running now. then coming back to fix other THINGs 



## 01/03/21 10:42 to 10:43,

## 01/03/21 10:59 to 11:49, I'm going to try and fix the www site +EQT
The problem was that the plugin used to generate the pages isn't gituhb friendly, so I'm building locally and pushing the site in the docs directory. 

I fixed the issues with the pages and improved the css. There is more to do but I'm happy with it.  


## 01/03/21 14:08 to 14:25, Start of stream again (D Google Ads Volunteer) 30 Write a supertitle landing page @eqt 
So the problem with this is that a supertitle landing page means that the project page gets broken up. 

There's some other problems with the project page: 
* White Water Writers doesn't have posts listed with it. 
* I think this boils down to 'implement the issues raised by the google ad words people.
