Gratitude! 

This week I'm grateful for exercise - I've managed to cycle, swim, and go to the gym.  I'm grateful for reading interesting books so I can tell Kat lots of things while she is trying to go to sleep. I'm grateful for time watching good films with Kat. 

I'm grateful for an unprecedented amount of being in touch with my emotions, all manner of bad things have been avoided. 

I'm grateful for old friends getting back in touch, Leo doing super well with reading (and counting),  a bit more energy, and a spring in my step. I'm thankful for being on top of work (ish, probably, I think), and being able to drive things a little more. 

We had a 'yes' day for the kids on Saturday - there was ice-cream and trips to the trampoline park, and McDonald's and all manner of fun. It was lovely.
