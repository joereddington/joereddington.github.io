Kat tells me this is her favourite photo ever. 
Gratitude! Specifically my 159th weekly gratitude post (It's probably slightly less because a few weeks go missed here and there). 
This week I'm grateful for meeting new people who are passionate about their own fascinating things, for Sharing Nova's flips with Rachel , puns with Clare and a personality test that told me I was a terrible person, but in a fun way, for which I blame Lyle
, for parenting ideas from @es, for the normal brutal education in probability from Mark et al. 

BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY - Nova's joy at going down the Very Big Slide All By Herself.
