I am very grumpy, so it's a good time to do gratitude.

I really enjoyed visiting the [Fashion and Textile Museum](https://fashiontextilemuseum.org/), which had some fascinating gems. I was also very grateful to Andrew for moonlighting as a courier so I didn't have to drive to campus, to the people who looked after me while I was trying to promote the university, and to everybody who made Leo's first year at school wonderful.

Thank you to Fatima for keeping me sane on Tuesdays, and to the many, many people who are needed to keep me sane the rest of the week. Thank you to everybody I caught up with at a Saturday birthday party, and I am extremely grateful that all the trains worked well enough that I made it home. (I'm also quite grateful that nobody threw up on me on the journey, which is a serious possibility at St Pancras late on a Saturday night.) I'm pleased to have got some DIY done (I think it's the first time I've ever voluntarily painted something) and to have had a chance to sneak off with Nova to climb or ride their new bike.

However, I'm most grateful that it's much less hot than it was.
