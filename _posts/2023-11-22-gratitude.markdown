{% assign start_date = '2018-01-01' | date: "%s" %}
{% assign current_date = site.time | date: "%s" %}
{% assign seconds_per_week = 604800 %}
{% assign weeks_since_start = current_date | minus: start_date | divided_by: seconds_per_week %}

A weekly list of things I'm grateful for - it's been {{ weeks_since_start }} weeks since I started doing these (I did miss last week). 

Some weeks I sit down to write these and think `What the hell did I do this week?' 

I'm grateful I've got a working computer again, also for having sensibe backup systems, and for finnishing a few bits of house DIY.  I absolutely loved building a new office chair with Leo and family ice skating.   I've bought a new water bottle in the absolute belief that a new water bottle will fix everything in my life: I'm enjoying that feeling while it lasts.
