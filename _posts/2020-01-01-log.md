## 07/09/20 09:19 to 09:49, Upgrading +EQT emails 
So right now I can send mail (to gmail) from joe@equalitytime.co.uk from G-suite -but the autoresponder goes to joeequalitytime@gmail (which should happen) 

However, the email "Test Monday" to joe@www goes to joeeqaulity@gmail which is not what I want and might be some problem with DNS propergation. 

## 07/09/20 09:49 to 10:03, +EQT
* I had planned to only move the www email accounts, but I've actually moved the eqt ones as well because I'd already created some eqt ones in Gsuite. 

## 07/09/20 10:03 to 10:39, +EQT
I've started the process of pointing the DNS records at the github pages site. It's sort of working, but there's a problem with the css?

## 08/09/20 08:03 to 08:53, Doing notes. +EQT
* Also working out some next steps, as always
* Also wrote the webmasters question: https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/q/131325/14932 

## 08/09/20 09:12 to 09:20, More fixing notes, more getting on top of everything. +EQT
I like that this way of doing notes is working better. Like, there's a lot of work that happens when processing the notes and it's worth doing, particularly in concert with the internet files. 

## 08/09/20 09:21 to 09:33, Thinking about good ways of using log files

## 08/09/20 09:48 to 10:10, +EQT Timesheet broken

## 08/09/20 10:38 to 10:48, +EQT fixing WWW site 

## 09/09/20 07:23 to 07:38, Writing up notes 
Notes on notes: 
* I'm NOT taking enought. 

## 09/09/20 07:38 to 07:56, Thinking about notes 
* I want A place for them to be stored (that is backed up) 
* I want to write them locally first and then work up. 
* I'm tired. 
* Today I have to do the actual THINGs I'm meant to be doing. 
* But first, let me actually fix the THING.  

So where to put this? 
* It's one big file. I'd like to have it under version control MAYBE? Or MAYBE simply occsaionally backed up. It probably has to live on the server for the timesheet STUFF to work... 
* I could simply paste it into the timesheet... 
* I want it public because that's what I want. 
* It's effectively a weblog, so it goes on the personal site. That's the backup.   


## 09/09/20 07:38 to 07:56, Thinking about notes 
I've put the main log file in the blog for now. 
...and While I'm here, I'll treat myself to moving a post. 

## 09/09/20 07:56, So what's the next THING on the list. 
* Ah, a problem with doing it locally is that I don't have an easy way to reach the todo list. Let's see how we do.  

## 09/09/20 08:09 to 08:12, https://github.com/eQualityTime/Home/issues/105 
Sorting out minutes first 

## 09/09/20 08:46 to 09:18, Fixing minutes +EQT


## 10/09/20 07:07 to 07:50, Starting with Google analytics  
* Notes: Twitter isn't that healthy, particularly in terms of - unit-per-post. 
* fb is driving most of my links, despitre the fact that I hardly ever post links there. 
* Linkedin is doing suprisingly well, worth keeping going on that. 
* YouTube has it's own analtics, but it turns out you can put a GA code in there. 
* I haven't properly set up the analtics for the new WWW site. 

## 10/09/20 07:52 to 07:56, Writing up notes 

## 10/09/20 07:56 to 09:35, Email +EQT

* I've imported contacts 
* I'm looking at importing all mail. 
  * I think I have to wait 24 hours for mail import.
* I have one email to write. 

## 10/09/20 10:20 to 10:30, +EQT
* I have two emails to write. 
  * One to the prison. Done
- 10/09/20 smallest next step:  I literally  have to read an email. 

Okay, the issue is that the SK and bg files don't convert well with OBF. I'd better convert them and see what happens.
