It has been an extremely horrible couple of weeks, so I very much need to do a gratitude.  

I’m thankful for:  

* Nice colleagues  
* Leo riding their bike really well  
* Making Leo’s bike by taking apart Leo's old bike and Nova’s old bike and forging some sort of Frankenstein’s bike out of the bits  
* Getting to go to the gym and go swimming  
* Nobody being in hospital right now  
* Being excited to start teaching term  
* Being safe at home  
* Nova arguing with me about how to say “Neolithic”  
* Leo really getting on with their new teacher  
* Chats with Mum  
* Kat being totally badass about doing a very large amount of parenting in my absence  
* My new Blender course  
* Getting to do more woodwork (Nova’s chair is taking shape — they are very sceptical)
