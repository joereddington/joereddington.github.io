title: 'Private in Public: a weekend project.'

Last weekend I took a day to play around with code and make a small project happen.

I wanted a bookmarklet that allowed you to encrypt small sections of the content you write into webpages.Â  So it would convert

'I like [postmen]' into

'I like [e:U2FsdGVkX1/s5MdPIxsWMO0XvnZoWhcAM/76AWI6Y/I=]'

(obviously, when you are viewing the encrypted text, the bookmarklet will also let you view it).

All of the code and instructions are [here](https://github.com/joereddington/PrivateInPublic), and below are some screenshots of it in action.

The next step is to make it into a Chrome Extension, which I've done, but which needs some polishing before it goes properly live on the store. Maybe that's a thing for another weekend.
