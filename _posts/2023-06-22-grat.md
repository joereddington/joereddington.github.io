I've received some truly absurd acts of generosity this week that have humbled me completely. You all know you you are. 

I've been out and about a lot lately - a wonderful evening with Simon at Quantum Leopard, which I highly recommend; finally turning up to the local toastmasters, and going to various meetings - and I could only do all that because Kat handled the kids' bedtimes while I was out.  The kids have been great - Leo nailed their first dentist appointment, and Nova has been exactly as lively and cheerful as always. (Although as I type this, Nova is yelling about something...) 

I'm looking forward to dinners with international friends, phone calls from people excited about plans, Nova's first sports day, lunch with on old friend in a few minutes and an exciting weekend for Kat's birthday.
