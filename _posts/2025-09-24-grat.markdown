Weekly Gratitude!  This week I'm grateful for: 

* Sleep
* Sleep
* Sleep, honestly it's really good 
* We've switched our Aga back on after the summer so I'm grateful for a toasty warm kitchen and the ability to cook a bunch more stuff. I celebrated with tofu scramble  
* Nobody stealing my bike even thought I left it unlocked at the train station for the whole day. 
* Kat DIYing our curtain pole 
* The kids playing 'spies' together
* Neighbours coming to vast 
* Pleasant day out in London
* Nice walk with Kat
