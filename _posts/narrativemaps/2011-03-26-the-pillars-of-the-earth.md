From wikipedia:

_**The Pillars of the Earth**_ is a [historical novel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_novel) by [Ken Follett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Follett) published in [1989](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_in_literature "1989 in literature") about the building of a [cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral) in the fictional town of Kingsbridge, [England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England). It is set in the middle of the 12th century, primarily during [the Anarchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anarchy), between the time of the sinking of the [White Ship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Ship) and the murder of [Thomas Becket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Becket). The book traces the development of [Gothic architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_architecture) out of the preceding [Romanesque architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanesque_architecture) and the fortunes of the Kingsbridge [priory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priory) against the backdrop of actual historical events of the time.
