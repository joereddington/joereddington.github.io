From wikipedia:

_**The Count of Monte Cristo**_ ([French](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language"): _Le Comte de Monte-Cristo_) is an adventure novel by [Alexandre Dumas, père](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Dumas,_p%C3%A8re "Alexandre Dumas, père"). It is often considered to be, along with _[The Three Musketeers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers "The Three Musketeers")_, Dumas&#8217; most popular work. He completed the work in 1844. Like many of his novels, it is expanded from the plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter [Auguste Maquet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Maquet "Auguste Maquet").<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_of_Monte_Cristo#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup>

The story takes place in [France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France"), [Italy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy"), islands in the [Mediterranean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean "Mediterranean") and the [Levant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant "Levant") during the historical events of 1815-1838 (from just before the [Hundred Days](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Days "Hundred Days") through to the reign of [Louis-Philippe of France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis-Philippe_of_France "Louis-Philippe of France")). The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book. It is an adventure story primarily concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy and forgiveness.

Apologies for the massive diagram: there are 117 chapters numbered from 1-117. and you can click on the diagram for a closure look (you&#8217;d probably want to)
