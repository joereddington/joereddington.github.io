_**2001: A Space Odyssey**_ ([1968](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968 "1968")) is a [science fiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction") [novel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel "Novel") by [Arthur C. Clarke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke "Arthur C. Clarke"). It was developed concurrently with [Stanley Kubrick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick "Stanley Kubrick")&#8216;s [film version](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_%28film%29 "2001: A Space Odyssey (film)") and published after the release of the film. The story is based in part on various [short stories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_stories "Short stories") by Clarke, most notably &#8220;_[The Sentinel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sentinel_%28short_story%29 "The Sentinel (short story)")_&#8221; (written in 1948 for a BBC competition but first published in 1951 under the title &#8220;_Sentinel of Eternity_&#8220;).

This is an interesting one, of course, because it is _kind of_ the book-of-the film&#8230; one of these days I&#8217;ll pull out the film script as well to see how close they look :).Â  24 chapters helpfully numbered and you can click on the image for a closer look.
