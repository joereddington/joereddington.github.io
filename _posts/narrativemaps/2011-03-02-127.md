From Wikipedia:_ **The Two Towers**_ is the second volume of [J. R. R. Tolkien](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien)&#8216;s [high fantasy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_fantasy) novel _[The Lord of the Rings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings)_. It is preceded by _[The Fellowship of the Ring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring)_ and followed by _[The Return of the King](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Return_of_the_King_%28book%29 "The Return of the King (book)")_.

The chapters are fairly unhelpfully numbered: numbers 1-11 refer to Chapters 1-11 but then&#8230;
