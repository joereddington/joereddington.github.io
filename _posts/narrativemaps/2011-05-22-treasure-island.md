From Wikipedia:

_**Treasure Island**_ is an adventure novel by Scottish author [Robert Louis Stevenson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Louis_Stevenson "Robert Louis Stevenson"), narrating a tale of &#8220;pirates and buried gold&#8221;. First published as a book on 23rd May 1883, it was originally serialized in the children&#8217;s magazine _[Young Folks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Folks_(magazine) "Young Folks (magazine)")_between 1881–82 under the title _Treasure Island; or, the mutiny of the Hispaniola_ and the pseudonym _Captain George North_.

Traditionally considered a [coming-of-age story](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildungsroman "Bildungsroman"), it is an adventure tale known for its atmosphere, character and action, and also a wry commentary on the ambiguity of morality—as seen in [Long John Silver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_John_Silver "Long John Silver")—unusual for [children&#8217;s literature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_literature "Children's literature") then and now. It is one of the most frequently dramatized of all novels. The influence of _Treasure Island_ on popular perception of[pirates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates "Pirates") is vast, including [treasure maps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_map "Treasure map") with an &#8220;X&#8221;, [schooners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schooners "Schooners"), [the Black Spot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Spot "The Black Spot"), [tropical islands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deserted_island "Deserted island"), and one-legged seamen with [parrots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrots "Parrots") on their [shoulders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder "Shoulder").<sup id="cite_ref-Cordingly-overestimated_0-0"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_Island#cite_note-Cordingly-overestimated-0">[1]</a></sup>
