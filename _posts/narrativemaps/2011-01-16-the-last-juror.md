From Wikipedia:

_**The Last Juror**_ is a 2004 legal thriller [novel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel "Novel") by [John Grisham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Grisham "John Grisham"), first published by [Doubleday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleday_%28publisher%29 "Doubleday (publisher)") on February 3, 2004.<sup id="cite_ref-0"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Juror#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup>

The story is set in the fictional town of Clanton, Mississippi from [1970](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970 "1970") to [1979](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979 "1979"). Clanton is also the venue for John Grisham&#8217;s first novel _[A Time To Kill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Time_To_Kill "A Time To Kill")_ which was published in [1989](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989 "1989"). Some of the characters appear in both novels with the same occupation and characteristics. Although _A Time to Kill_ was published sixteen years before _The Last Juror_, it was set in the present, so presumably it took place in [1985](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985 "1985") or [1986](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986 "1986"). Therefore the characters which appear in both novels, such as Lucien Wilbanks and Harry Rex Vonner, have matured in _A Time to Kill_. Harry Rex Vonner also appears in the novel _The Summons_, published in [2002](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002 "2002"), as an advisor of the protagonist Ray Atlee.

The chapters are helpfully numbered 1 to 44.
