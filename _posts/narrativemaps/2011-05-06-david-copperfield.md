From wikipedia: _**David Copperfield**_ or _**The Personal History, Adventures, Experience and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger of Blunderstone Rookery (which he never meant to publish on any account)**_<sup id="cite_ref-0"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Copperfield_(novel)#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup> is a [novel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel "Novel") by [Charles Dickens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens "Charles Dickens"), first published as a novel in 1850. Like most of his works, it originally appeared in [serial form](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_(literature) "Serial (literature)") a year earlier. Many elements within the novel follow events in Dickens&#8217; own life, and it is probably the most [autobiographical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobiography "Autobiography") of all of his novels.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Copperfield_(novel)#cite_note-1">[2]</a></sup> In the preface to the 1867 Charles Dickens edition, he wrote, &#8220;… like many fond parents, I have in my heart of hearts a favourite child. And his name is David Copperfield.&#8221; <sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Copperfield_(novel)#cite_note-2">[3]</a></sup>
