From wikipedia:

_**Brave New World**_ is a [novel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel "Novel") by [Aldous Huxley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldous_Huxley "Aldous Huxley"), written in 1931 and published in 1932. Set in London of AD 2540 (632 A.F. in the book), the novel anticipates developments in [reproductive technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_technology "Reproductive technology") and [sleep-learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep-learning "Sleep-learning") that combine to change society. The future society is an embodiment of the ideals that form the basis of [futurology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurology "Futurology"). Huxley answered this book with a reassessment in an essay, _[Brave New World Revisited](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World#Brave_New_World_Revisited)_ (1958), and with his final work, a novel titled _[Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_(novel) "Island (novel)")_ (1962).
