From wikipedia:

_**Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There**_ (1871) is a work of  [literature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature "Literature") by [Lewis Carroll](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll "Lewis Carroll") (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson). It is the sequel to _[Alice&#8217;s Adventures in Wonderland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland")_ (1865). The themes and settings of _Through the Looking-Glass_ make it a kind of [mirror image](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_image "Mirror image") of _Wonderland_: the first book begins outdoors, in the warm month of May (May 4),<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Through_the_Looking_Glass#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup> uses frequent changes in size as a [plot device](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_device "Plot device"), and draws on the imagery of playing cards; the second opens indoors on a snowy, wintry night exactly six months later, on November 4 (the day before [Guy Fawkes Night](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes_Night "Guy Fawkes Night")),<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Through_the_Looking_Glass#cite_note-1">[2]</a></sup> uses frequent changes in time and spatial directions as a plot device, and draws on the imagery of [chess](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess "Chess"). In it, there are many mirror themes, including opposites, time running backwards, and so on.

There are only 12 chapters numbered from 1-12. and you can click on the diagram for a closure look.
