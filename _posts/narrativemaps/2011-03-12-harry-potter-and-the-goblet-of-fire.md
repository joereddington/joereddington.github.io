Rowling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling), published on 8 July 2000. The book attracted additional attention because of a pre-publication warning from J. K. Rowling that one of the characters would be murdered in the book.<sup title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from December 2010">[<em><a title="Wikipedia:Citation needed" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed">citation needed</a></em>]</sup> 3 million copies of the book were sold over the first weekend in the US alone.<sup id="cite_ref-0"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup>
