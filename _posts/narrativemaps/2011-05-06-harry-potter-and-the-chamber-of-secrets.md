_**Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets**_ is the second novel in the _[Harry Potter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter "Harry Potter")_ series written by [J. K. Rowling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling "J. K. Rowling"). The plot follows [Harry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_(character) "Harry Potter (character)")&#8216;s second year at [Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry "Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry"), during which a series of messages on the walls on the school&#8217;s corridors warn that the &#8220;Chamber of Secrets&#8221; has been opened and that the &#8220;heir of [Slytherin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slytherin "Slytherin")&#8221; will kill all pupils who do not come from all-magical families. These threats are followed by attacks which leave residents of the school &#8220;petrified&#8221; (that is, frozen). Throughout the year, Harry and his friends [Ron Weasley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Weasley "Ron Weasley") and [Hermione Granger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger "Hermione Granger") investigate the attacks, and Harry is confronted by [Lord Voldemort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Voldemort "Lord Voldemort"), who is attempting to regain full power. There are 17 chapters, and you can click for a better look.
