From wikipedia:

_**Nineteen Eighty-Four**_ (sometimes written _**1984**_) is a 1949 novel that reflects a dystopia by [George Orwell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell) about an [oligarchical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy "Oligarchy"), [collectivist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivist "Collectivist") society. Life in the [Oceanian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceania_%28Nineteen_Eighty-Four%29 "Oceania (Nineteen Eighty-Four)") province of [Airstrip One](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrip_One "Airstrip One") is a world of [perpetual war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_war), pervasive government [surveillance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance), and incessant public [mind control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_control). The individual is always subordinated to the state, and it is in part this philosophy which allows the Party to manipulate and control humanity. In the [Ministry of Truth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Truth), protagonist [Winston Smith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Smith) is a [civil servant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_servant "Civil servant") responsible for perpetuating the Party&#8217;s [propaganda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda) by [revising historical records](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_revisionism_%28negationism%29 "Historical revisionism (negationism)") to render the Party omniscient and always correct, yet his meagre existence disillusions him to the point of seeking [rebellion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebellion) against [Big Brother](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_%28Nineteen_Eighty-Four%29 "Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)"), eventually leading to his arrest, torture, and reconversion.

As literary [political fiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_fiction), _Nineteen Eighty-Four_ is a classic novel of the [social science fiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science_fiction) subgenre. Since its publication in 1949, many of its terms and concepts, such as _[Big Brother](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_%28Nineteen_Eighty-Four%29 "Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)")_, _[doublethink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublethink)_, _[thoughtcrime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughtcrime)_, _[Newspeak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak)_, and _[Memory hole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hole)_, have become contemporary [vernacular](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular). In addition, the novel popularized the adjective _[Orwellian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orwellian)_, which refers to lies, surveillance, or manipulation of the past in the service of a totalitarian agenda.
