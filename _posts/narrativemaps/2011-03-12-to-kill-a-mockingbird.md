From Wikipedia:

_**To Kill a Mockingbird**_ is a novel by [Harper Lee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper_Lee) published in [1960](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_in_literature "1960 in literature"). It was instantly successful, winning the [Pulitzer Prize](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize), and has become a classic of modern [American literature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_literature). The plot and characters are loosely based on the author&#8217;s observations of her family and neighbors, as well as on an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10Â years old.

The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with the serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator&#8217;s father, [Atticus Finch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atticus_Finch), has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. One critic explains the novel&#8217;s impact by writing, &#8220;In the twentieth century, _To Kill a Mockingbird_ is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-crespino_0-0"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Kill_a_Mockingbird#cite_note-crespino-0">[1]</a></sup>
