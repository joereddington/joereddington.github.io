Okay, so we&#8217;ve looked at the [first](http://www.projecttoomanycooks.co.uk/?p=36), [second](http://www.projecttoomanycooks.co.uk/?p=127) and [third](http://www.projecttoomanycooks.co.uk/?p=136) parts so now we&#8217;re going to look at the whole thing.

I&#8217;ve taken more from Wikipedia than I normally do because it&#8217;s useful to illustrate the point:

_**The Lord of the Rings**_ is an [epic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_%28genre%29 "Epic (genre)") [fantasy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_fantasy "High fantasy") novel written by [philologist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philology "Philology") and [University of Oxford](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford) professor [J. R. R. Tolkien](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien). The story began as a sequel to Tolkien&#8217;s earlier, less complex children&#8217;s fantasy novel _[The Hobbit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit)_ (1937), but eventually developed into a much larger work. It was written in stages between 1937 and 1949, much of it during the [Second World War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War").<sup id="cite_ref-WW_0-0"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings#cite_note-WW-0">[1]</a></sup>Although known to most readers as a trilogy, the work was initially intended by Tolkien to be one volume of a two-volume set, with the other being _[The Silmarillion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silmarillion)_.<sup id="cite_ref-tale_1-0"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings#cite_note-tale-1">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings#cite_note-2">[3]</a></sup> However, when Tolkien submitted the first volume entitled _The Lord of the Rings_ to his publisher, it was decided for economic reasons to publish the work as three separate volumes, each consisting of two books, over the course of a year in 1954–55, creating the now familiar _Lord of the Rings_ trilogy.

Anyway&#8230;.  The novel is split into  The Fellowship of the Ring (sections 1-22),  The Two Towers (sections &#8211; 23 &#8211; 43), and The Return of the King (sections 44-62).  You can, of course see a larger version by clicking on the image, but it should be pretty obvious that the book divisions are fairly arbitrary.
