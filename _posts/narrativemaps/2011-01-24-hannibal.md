_**Hannibal**_ is a [novel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel "Novel") written by [Thomas Harris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Harris "Thomas Harris"), published in 1999. It is the third in his series featuring his iconic character Dr. [Hannibal Lecter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Lecter "Hannibal Lecter"), the [cannibalistic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibal "Cannibal") [serial killer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer "Serial killer"), and the second to feature [FBI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI "FBI") Special Agent [Clarice Starling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarice_Starling "Clarice Starling"). The novel takes place seven years after the events of _[The Silence of the Lambs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silence_of_the_Lambs_%28novel%29 "The Silence of the Lambs (novel)")_ and deals with the intended revenge of one of [Hannibal Lecter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Lecter "Hannibal Lecter")&#8216;s victims. It was adapted as a [film of the same name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_%28film%29 "Hannibal (film)") in 2001, directed by [Ridley Scott](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott "Ridley Scott").

It has 102 chapters &#8211; although confusingly, it goes straight from 100 to 102 in my copy and then gives chapter 103&#8230; can anyone with a copy to hand shed any light?
