May have got a bit carried away with this one.Â  Dan Brown has a _lot_ of chapters.

_**Digital Fortress**_ is a [techno-thriller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno-thriller "Techno-thriller") [novel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel "Novel") written by [American](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States") [author](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author "Author") [Dan Brown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Brown "Dan Brown") and published in [1998](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_in_literature "1998 in literature") by [St. Martin&#8217;s Press](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Martin%27s_Press "St. Martin's Press"). The book explores the theme of government surveillance of electronically stored information on the private lives of citizens, and the possible [civil liberties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties "Civil liberties") and ethical implications using such technology.

The chapters are numbered 1 to 128, and I removed the prologue and the epilogue.
