What am I grateful for this week? 

* Working at Herefordshire a couple of days a week is going much better - I'm starting to arrange my day to avoid the traffic, find nice routes to get from the car park to the office and generallyi get into the rhythms of talking to the students.
* Leo has been coming back from school with art and notes from friends and dojo points. 
* I had a fabulous weekend with family and friends
* I'm properly writing again - after quite a few months when I didn't have the energy to open the book. 
* Nova's face today when she did a difficult bit of piano she's been practicing. 
* A lovely date day with Kat
