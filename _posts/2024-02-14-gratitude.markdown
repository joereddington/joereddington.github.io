A weekly list of things I'm grateful for - it's been {{ weeks_since_start }} weeks since I started doing these (I did miss last week). 

Right, what has gone well since I last (7th February) did a gratitude post? 

* I cleared out the inspection pit in the garage (again!) - and I've made proper plans for how to upgrade it. 
    * I got to do some writing on my next book! Although mostly I moved around some pictures and updated some diagrams. It still counts.  
* I finally ticked off a scary to-do list item (it was sending an email, but tbf all my scariest to-do items involve 'sending an email') 
* I've been reading! I reread a book and am most of the way through _Unruly_.
* Some niggling neck/shoulder pains that have been bothering me for weeks (I think it was stress) have abated so I was able to get back on the mats at Judo 
* eQuality Time's accounts have been signed off by an external examiner - I'm very pleased by that. 
* I finally (it's actually only a week after I intended it) was able to start my pilot my 'better attendance tracking' approach for my lectures, which has already paid dividends. 
* My new pan is really good for flipping pancakes
