I'm feeling mildly despondent about the state of my news consumption.  I looked up  the news articles I've read over the last couple of weeks and I can see three that are about genuinely important events (and I would have done much better getting my information for Wikipedia on those) - the rest are me browsing celebrity culture or clickbait.  None of it made me happy and I don't think any of it made me in any way better informed.
