<h2>Background</h2> 
<p>In early 2017 <a href="http://joereddington.com/6435/2017/07/07/how-i-got-my-apple-watch-to-give-me-sleep-data-going-back-to-the-first-day-i-bought-it./" rel="nofollow">I wrote a blog post</a> detailing I how got my Apple Watch to give me historical sleep information.  It was useful and I ended up giving a talk about it at my local quanitifed self meeting up group.</p>


<p>It was always a faff getting the data off my phone and into the code so I spent some time moving it to run on the phone itself using <a href="http://omz-software.com/pythonista/" rel="nofollow">Pythonista</a></p>

This was the result:

<h2>Notes</h2> 
<ul>
<li>I used <a href=https://github.com/joereddington/watson/>this repository </a>
<li>This branch: <a href="https://github.com/joereddington/watson/tree/newsleep">https://github.com/joereddington/watson/tree/newsleep</a>
<li>And wrote my as-it-happened notes on <a href=https://github.com/joereddington/Projects-Public/issues/33>this Github issue</a>(with 'what to do next' plans. 
<li>It was very clear that the most comfortable way of doing code on the phone was with a Bluetooth keyboard, and possibly with a HMDI output device. Between Pythonesta and an ssh client, I'm happy with the concept that I could leave my laptop at home next time I'm going on a work trip.
