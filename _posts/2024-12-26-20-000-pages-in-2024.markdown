Last year I set a goal to read 10,000 pages in the year. It ended up being 12,194. You can read about it on [my blog](https://joereddington.com/2023/12/19/10-000-pages.html). 

At the start of this year I set myself a goal to read 20,000 pages in 2024. As of today I have reached 20,588.  

There were 87 books in total and I abandoned 26 without finishing them (I'm quite pleased with that; if I had felt I had to complete every single one then it would have been unhappy reading).   

At least four of the books made me cry, about 20 or so I can remember relatively little of. Ideally next year I'll be talking about 20 books that made me cry and four that I remember little of :) 

You can see the list of books [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rW_uqs8SWVOtPf7lTe_n-hII1kvKwfCfIloa_qZENvw/edit?usp=sharing) and have included the type of book, how far through it I got and if I had read it before. I wrote up some notes on each today and yesterday, but they hardly count as recommendations. 

My favourite book of the year was probably 'Hello Beautiful".  

Next year I'm going to stick to 20,000 but I'd like to move the quality of the books up (EDIT: neither of these things happened). One way I intend to do that is by adding some details about the author in terms of "Is this a straight white male?".
