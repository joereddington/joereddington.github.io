Nova was so obsessed with bike-to-school week that this is what she wore to cycling in the pouring rain on Monday. 

{% assign start_date = '2018-01-01' | date: "%s" %}
{% assign current_date = site.time | date: "%s" %}
{% assign seconds_per_week = 604800 %}
{% assign weeks_since_start = current_date | minus: start_date | divided_by: seconds_per_week %}

This week's gratitude  - it's been {{ weeks_since_start }} weeks since I started doing these. 

It's been a wonderful week. Admittedly it started with therapy, which is always painful but, you know, great.  

I've been exercising more and using the internet less. I've been writing more blog posts and generally feeling better in my skin. 

There was gymnastics and photo taking. I've been more present with the kids and read books.  DIY has happened and will continue to happen. 

I don't have any major deadlines (although I'm away with work all next week so I suspect I'll have some when I get home) and life is good.
