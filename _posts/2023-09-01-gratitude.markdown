A weekly list of things I'm grateful for: it's been {{ weeks_since_start }} weeks since I started doing these. 

This week I'm grateful for successful operations, friends with new jobs, people who are experts in helping me work out the right cable I need, spontaneous days out with Nova, an enormous amount of vegetables, an amazing homemade mousse, new cookery toys to play with, an evening sorting out my (rather than work's) todo list, and a couple of new projects that I'm nurturing an interest in. 

We're close to the end of holidays so we've been playing with squishy body toys, learning about sails by building a pirate ship for the bath, and finding new and interesting ways of making the kids laugh (Leo fall over laughing at my banging my head on something this week)
