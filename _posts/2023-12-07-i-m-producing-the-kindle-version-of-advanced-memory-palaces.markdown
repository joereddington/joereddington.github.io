I'm currently producing the Kindle version of Advanced Memory Palaces.   That's a lot harder than it sounds because I've got to change a [large amount of the typesetting](https://joereddington.com/2023/09/18/problems-with-typesetting-latex-to-pub.html) to get it to work. Also, I don't want to have to maintain two different versions of the text so I'm trying to make sure that everything will _also_ compile to a pdf.‚Å∞

Helpfully, I recently started writing a book directly for the Kindle. It's far from publishable but I solved enough of the typesetting-for-epub problems there that I could make a solid effort at producing the Kindle version of Advanced Memory Palaces. 

So far I've: 

* Fixed Linkboxes
* Found four or so typos that are hard to see in the print book but much more obvious in the epub format
* Converted all the footnotes to endnotes
* Fixed my (over)use of math mode.  

I've got to find solutions to: 
* Image sizing (in such a way that I can still produce the pdf) 
* Tables  
* Finding a decent local epub viewer (I think I might be resorting to plugging in my old kindle by USB and JUST directly looking at versions that way) 
* Fixing footnotes-within-linkboxes in such a way that it doesn't break for the pdf. 
* The visual representative of the 'class' structure. 

This project will be done-done when I've both released an actual Kindle version _and_ updated the pdf on the paperback version to one that is more flexible (and has fixed the typos I've found) 


Update (27 December): The Kindle version went live a few days after this post and I'm taking some time before returning to the pdf. My current excuse is that I want to work on my next book, but I don't appear to be getting much of that done either.
