title: "My new PC"
---

Written up for the nerds who care. 

I recently replaced my old mac-mini with a desktop.  

Despite being a computer science PhD (and a processor design one at that) I've been using laptops since I arrived at Uni and I feel like I have very little clue about which processor and so on to choose. 


In the end I used [PC specialist](https://www.pcspecialist.co.uk/) which have a nice interface which says things like "The motherboard you choose doesn't work with the processor you choose, are you sure?"  and thus saved me lots of money and heartache (they also have a nice (and presumably profitable) feature that will recommend you upgrades) 


The system I ended up with is this one:

To make matters more complex I, who have been using OSX for the best part of 20 years, took the opportunity to move over to Ubuntu - this was much easier than I expected - I've been heading in that direction for years and I'm starting to know my way around the terminal.  To make matters even more complex I'm running i3 on top of ubuntu.  I absolutely love it.  

My vim setup can be seen in [this github repo](https://github.com/joereddington/dotvimdirectory) and my i3 setup can be seen in [this one](https://github.com/joereddington/i3config). 


Everything is lovely and fast (I had to boot up the old machine for something recently and it was _painful_ and I'm enjoying it very much.
