---

At the end of an academic year, I am asked by some students to write them a reference. Often I have never met them.  

Here is the template I normally start with before editing in a way that is appropriate to the student.

> Bingo Heeler attended my course on Security Management in the academic year 23/24.  They did/did not ask me in advance if I would provide a reference.  They have not/have given me permission to share their marks for the course (75), their average for the year (62), and their final project (14).  
>
> Their (actual, measured by a secure system) attendance was 65%. 
>
> The course I teach has around 180 students and I: 
>
> * cannot easily bring Bingo to mind, which suggests that they pay their fees, submit work on time, and don't cause any trouble. 
> * can easily bring Bingo to mind. They were engaged, sensible and  produced good work. 
> 
> They have asked me to specifically talk about their skills in X, and I am happy to do so... 
> 
> I have no hesitation in recommending X to a Master's Degree.
