This week I'm grateful for: 

* Snowflakes
* Leo asking Nova to play torch mouse with him. 
* A nice visit from my parents 
* My Lego Bonsai tree 
* A general return to the normal pace of our lives to be honest.  
* Kat and I getting through a whole film in an evening. 
* A lovely clean house 
* Finally fixing the heating (it was working, but coming on at the wrong times) 
* Successfully fixing both the toilet and the car
* A successful MOT! (Unrelated to the bit of the car I needed to fix) 

But those are all little things.  Honestly this week I'm grateful for small progress over a period of years: there's a lot of stuff that was fine this month that the Joe of 2018 would have screwed up badly, or dealt with much less well.  Like, I feel tired and a little overwhelmed by everything, but at the same time - all my problems are pretty much first-world problems and I'm healthy and capable and looking forward to stuff.
