This week's gratitude  - it's been {{ weeks_since_start }} weeks since I started doing these. 

I'm in London most of this week:  I'm doing my first book camp in ages with a wonderful group of writers!  I'm grateful that the writing camps still fill me with energy: there are always wonderful moments as the narrative starts to come together than the students step up to lead. 

I can only do this because Kat is handling all the school runs and bedtimes for the week (and because the kids are being super well behaved). It's a wonderful freedom and I deeply appreciate it. 

Also - because I'm staying in London I've been able to go to plays and support groups and the Disney Store and meet FB for mini golf so it is turning into a wonderfully crowded and exhaustingly fun week.  

This week I'm grateful for parties with bouncy castles (and races through them), quiet recharging days, busy DIY days, presents ordered, children that miss me, Leo having successful settling sessions at school, family plans made and lots of little tasks ticked off.  Everything going well.
