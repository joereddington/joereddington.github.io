title: "HDMI audio" 
--- 

After faffing with headphones and Bluetooth for literally 18 months I realised I could pipe [my PC](https://joereddington.com/2023/07/05/pc.html)'s audio into the monitor. 

Here's what I ended up doing. 

```bash
pactl list short sinks
```

The ```pactl``` (which I have been thinking of as 'pact-al' when of course it's 'p(ulse) a(udio) control') program lets me talk to a running PulseAudio server.   This command lists all the available 'sinks' (output devices) in a short format. 

so now I can do this: 

```bash
pactl set-card-profile alsa_card.pci-0000_01_00.1 output:hdmi-stereo-extra1
```

...to switch from whatever was controlling the headphone jack to the HDMI output. See: 

```bash
joe@joe-main:~$ pactl list short sinks
1 alsa_output.pci-0000_0c_00.6.iec958-stereo  module-alsa-card.c  s16le 2ch 44100Hz SUSPENDED
253 alsa_output.pci-0000_01_00.1.hdmi-stereo  module-alsa-card.c  s16le 2ch 44100Hz RUNNING
joe@joe-main:~$ 
```
 
But not so fast - because now the audio is coming out of the wrong monitor - I have a nice big TV monitor and an old second monitor and the sound is coming out of the wrong one! 

So now I have to go into more detail. This command lists all audio cards with detailed information: 

```bash
pactl list cards
```

The output is very long but it tells me I have three cards. 

* AMD HD Audio Controller: this is the onboard audio controller integrated with my AMD Ryzen 3 CPU and ASUS motherboard and is presumably what I plug my headphones into on my tower. 
* NVIDIA HDA (High-Definition Audio): This is the audio output provided by my NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 GPU. It handles audio output over HDMI connections. It also tells me which HDMI ports are connected.  
* A third card (AMD Radeon HD Audio Controller): its use is unclear. 

Now I can use this command: 


```bash
pactl set-card-profile alsa_card.pci-0000_01_00.1 output:hdmi-stereo-extra1
```

To set the correct HDMI output (I got the stereo-extra1 part from listing the cards). I also set the default: 

```bash
pactl set-default-sink alsa_output.pci-0000_01_00.1.hdmi-stereo-extra1
```

But that doesn't appear to survive a reboot. More to do here...



## Update




For reasons I don't fully understand, I started getting crackling speakers and then the above didn't work after a restart so I ended up doing this: 

```bash
pulseaudio -k
pulseaudio --start
pactl list short sinks
pactl load-module module-alsa-sink device=hdmi:CARD=NVidia,DEV=0
pactl list short sinks
paplay --device=alsa_output.hdmi_CARD_NVidia_DEV_0 /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
```

...which is working okay and I'll come back and work that out later.


## Update 2
After [reinstalling Ubuntu for another reason](https://joereddington.com/2025/01/07/factory-reset.html), this worked: 

```bash
sudo apt install pulseaudio
pactl list short sinks
pactl load-module module-alsa-sink device=hdmi:CARD=NVidia,DEV=0
pactl set-card-profile alsa_card.pci-0000_01_00.1 output:hdmi-stereo-extra1
pactl list short sinks
pactl set-default-sink 123A #music starts coming from youtube
paplay --device=alsa_output.hdmi_CARD_NVidia_DEV_0 /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
```

# TODO 
* I've never got bluetooth working 
* I'd like a much easier way of switching between outputs (headphones/speakers and so on)
