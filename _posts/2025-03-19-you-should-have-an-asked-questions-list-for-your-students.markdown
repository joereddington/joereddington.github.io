First of all, this is [very Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/do-they-deserve-the-gift-of-your-keystrokes), so thank you for that Scott. 

Secondly, I'm NOT talking about students with issues that are outside the course - emails about housing issues, having to take time off due to illness, 
raising an issue about a staff member or another student, or generally panicking, are part of the job of 'supporting learners' and get the thoughtful attention they deserve. 

Now... 

Students, whatever you might think, don't like emailing you for information, they do so only when they can't find the answer anywhere.  Every email you get that asks a question that a student can find in the documentation tells you two things:
 
* that the documentation is insufficient. 
* that this issue is important to the students.

However, it's also annoying to give a serious, thorough answer to a question you've answered four times. 

So I maintain an 'Asked questions' list. 

The rule is this. Any question (that is NOT personal, private, or completely confused) that I receive gets one of two sentences in the answer: 

* “Your question will be useful to other students so I have put it into the ‘Asked Questions’ file (link)
* This is a great question, it’s number X on the ‘Asked Questions’ file (link) and I’ve added to it in response to your question”  

The 'I've added to it' is important. Each repeated question is a vote on the 'how important is this issue to students' scale and I should respond to that by making the answer more and more detailed and complete each time.  It also avoids shaming the students for asking the question. If I answered "This is number 12 dumbass" then I'm unlikely to get much interaction out of the student in future. 

After a few iterations you have a document that:  
    * avoids multiple students sending the same question 
    * means students with the same issue get an answer immediately 

IY3501 has had an 'Asked Questions' document for two years. It's nothing fancy - it's literally a Word document on OneDrive. The first year it had 18 entires, the second year I added only four. I'm not expecting to add many next year.
