This week's gratitude  - it's been {{ weeks_since_start }} weeks since I started doing these. 

Hello.  

I'm very pleased my fitness has gone up.  That's something I'm super grateful for. Since late 2022 I've gradually managed to add more running and cycling and even gone back to Judo and I'm as fit as I ever was (admittedly, this is not a high bar).  I got a really good (for me) parkrun time and it feels like validation. 

I'm super happy that Leo's school transition morning went well - and that I had people to talk to while he pottered off to a classroom. Also that we've started to find ways to make learning letters fun.  I'm pleased that the rain held off for Nova's school sports day, that Nova's trial of Judo went well (Nova is enthusiastic for more, but I have enough trouble getting her to the sports already committed to...) 

Today I got to see my sister for the first time in ages! That was lovely!  Thank you for coming all that way. :) 

I'm grateful to go to wonderfully nerdy parties, seeing Kat do her triathlon, picnics in the park, time spent in a university library, fixing a chair with the kids, wrestling with Leo, watching the election results with Leo and watching Football with Kat.
