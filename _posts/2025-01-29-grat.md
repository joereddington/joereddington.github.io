This week's gratitude - it's been {{ weeks_since_start }} weeks since I started doing these. 

I should say, the picture is from D20, which is where Nova wanted her birthday treat (mostly for the vegan milkshakes) and I'm super grateful that the Leo's 'win at all costs and flip the board if you don't' disposition has mellowed into something slightly more collaborative. 

I'm grateful for a really well received talk at a [Children & Young People Now](https://www.cypnow.co.uk/conferences) conference on Thursday, and a reasonable webinar on Friday. 

On Friday there was a moment I was reading a novel in the front room while the kids were asleep and at one point I looked up and it was a empty quiet room and I felt totally peaceful. That was wonderful. 

I'm grateful for nice, and honest, chats with mum, making excellent roast potatoes, Leo doing parkrun (and football!) for the first time in ages, and playing boardgames with Kat. I loved running 'daddy school' with the kids, ticking off some exam preparation and a nice cup of tea with Dave.
