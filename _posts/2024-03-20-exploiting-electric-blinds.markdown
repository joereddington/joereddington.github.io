tl;dr rather than spending £300 per window to get electric blinds put into my house, I took advantage of the company's minimum order to do it for £59.99 per blind. 

# How I cheaply upgraded the blinds in my house.

Over the last few years we've covered the house with custom blackout blinds from https://www.swiftdirectblinds.co.uk/.  They do accurate measurements and have reasonable costs (they take a while, I assume they get manufactured overseas).  

We splashed out and got an electric blind for the last one.  I love it, and I decided to upgrade the rest of the blinds in the house.  

It's hard to find the motors online to upgrade the existing ones. This was the best option I could find:

..and £120 feels expensive. 

The opinion of the Swift is that you can't get just the electric motors and fit them yourself, you have to buy a whole new blind.  I don't fancy spending another £300 per (large) window to replace blinds that are less than two years old so this is what I did. 

Swift Blinds advertise their electric blinds as being 'from £59.99'.

Now obviously, the £60 version is for a uselessly small blind of 30cm by 30cm

You get the impression that the only reason that offer such a small blind is so they can say 'from £59.99'. But that uselessly small blind does come with one of those motors that appear to be £120 on ebay.  So I ordered one.  


The impression that they don't expect anyone to order a £59.99 blind is strengthened by emails like this:

(I actually think this is a change in their manufacturing - I've done this several times and only the most recent one had a problem) 


...and indeed, they slot directly in! Nova's blind and the downstairs blind were trivially upgraded this way.  

One of the blinds (in our bedroom) actually had a larger diameter because it was across a very large window so I had to do a little bit more work. I took the material off the smaller tube, and measured it against the existing blind. The small tube very nearly fit inside the larger one, so I took the motor out and squashed the end of the smaller tube slightly in my vice.

That made it mostly fit: Nova helped by pounding the tube in with a hammer.

It also made it a little tight to install the motor: this problem was solved by Vaseline.

Now everything works beautifully and we're woken by the daylight in the morning as the blind automatically comes up. It's lovely (and it will be super handy for keeping the home cool in the summer)
