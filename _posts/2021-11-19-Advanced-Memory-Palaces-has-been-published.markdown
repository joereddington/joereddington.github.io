Last week I finally published [Advanced Memory Palaces](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Advanced-Memory-Palaces-second-should/dp/B09GJFZ6JM/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=advanced+memory+palaces&qid=1637332836&sr=8-2).  

I'd started writing it (by which I mean, I'd put together 40 pages of text around the central idea) in about 2012, and then put it away until the start of the COVID lockdown - I was in a hotel room with little to do and it was therapeutic to crank out some pages. 

Almost none of the original 40 pages survived, but I'm extremely happy with the result. I'm also very much looking forward to getting my free time back.
