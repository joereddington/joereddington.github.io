title: "Yesterday my older brother died"
---

My older brother Graham died yesterday.  He was my boyhood idol, and my teenage hero.  I don't have words to describe how I'm feeling. I'm happy he had family with him in hospital.
The are more recent photos, but this is the only one I have of all four of us together.
