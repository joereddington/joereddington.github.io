A weekly list of things I'm grateful for - it's been {{ weeks_since_start }} weeks since I started doing these. 


What made me happy this week? 

* When I pick up Leo from the nursery and the staff tell me that he had a great day. 
* Nova being excited to tell me things. 
* Giving blood. 
* Time spend in the garage building things. 
* Having ideas.    
* Properly having concentrated time on projects. (finally getting the look of the White Water Writers Software where I want it) 
* A working fan in the car. 
* New TV(!)
