I've never got 100% of the trophies on a game before. But Spider-Man on the PS4, which I've now played through twice in the space of six months (on [this bike](https://joereddington.com/2023/02/28/bike.html)), is so joyous to play that I did it almost by accident.  It's an absolute triumph (and, yes, I'm aware it's now five years old) of a game, with a control system that made me smile from the very first moments and a storyline that made me weep (which, is a very tragic thing while using the exercise bike at the same time). 

I bought the sequel today, but I'm going to try to play at lest one other title in between to give myself a little bit of a break.
