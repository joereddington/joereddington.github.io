It&#8217;s been a little over three months since I stopped being an arse about semantics.

I didn&#8217;t think I was at the time, I thought I was just helping make sure everyone was understood. If people are talking about things in the correct way then communication is easier and the world gets better right?  I&#8217;ve [even written angry things](http://joereddington.com/3107/2014/05/09/do-not-let-other-peoples-ideas-of-correct-english-get-in-the-way-of-great-english/) about it.

Turns out I was being an arse.  And the way I found out was thought a web comic.  This one:

and it stopped me stone dead at &#8220;Vindictive about things that are often uncomfortably transparent proxies for race or social class&#8221;.

I&#8217;m sensitive about class issues, and very aware that I should be doing more on issues of race and it was an awful jolt to see it be put that way.    Instantly it was clear that I had become something that I hate, and that the hate was far stronger than any reason I had to keep up the behaviour.

I&#8217;ve not &#8216;corrected&#8217; anyone&#8217;s grammar since September, and I&#8217;m working hard to avoid anything of the &#8220;I think you mean&#8221; variety. I&#8217;m trying to check my understanding obviously, I&#8217;m trying to say things like &#8220;Can I check I understood? &#8221; when there&#8217;s doubt, and to _shut the hell up_ when there isn&#8217;t any doubt, but old habits die hard.

&nbsp;

Anyway, this is a public declaration that I&#8217;m stopping.  If you catch me doing it, feel free to tell me I&#8217;m a liar as well as an arse.
