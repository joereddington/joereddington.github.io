I've been behind on gratitude. Let me start again. 

I'm grateful for:

- The chilli Kat makes on date nights  
- Friends who visit  
- Parachute games and bubbles  
- [Cool electronics projects](https://joereddington.com/2025/03/09/advanced-spin-bike-speedometer.html)  
- Days without meetings  
- Sleep  
- Leo and Nova laughing uproariously  
- Dancing in the kitchen with Leo  
- Nova astonishing me on a regular basis  
- Leo winning 'Dojo Points Champion' at school  
- The kids cycling to the playground with their friends  
- Quietly listening to relaxing piano music in a dark room  
- Finding just the right Lego piece in Kat's stash of spares 
- Kat giggling like a little girl when I picked her up. 
- friends being okay
