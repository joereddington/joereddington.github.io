Gratitude!

I got to hold my son! I didn't think I was going to until the end of May, but various high up people granted permissions so I got to go in and have a 15 minute cuddle. There were snotty tears.

That's basically everything for this one. I got to hold him. I have so many other thank you's to make that I need to make a big list for next time.
