I've been reading [Gettings Things Done](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-free-Productivity/dp/0349408947). 

I've read it before and while I didn't like the presentation style I think it's full of useful things that helped my own workflow.  I expected that I might find it very dated coming back to it about a decade later, but again; it's full of useful things that I've let slip in my own workflow. 

One of the main principles of the book is that you should use a trusted list to keep track EVERYTHING you have to do and if you try and 'remember' things to do that causes stress and difficulty.  I believe that, and I would have told you I did it, but while I was reading the book I became very aware of all the little things I was trying to keep track of in my head and ended up filling up a few pages with things to do: it's amazing how suddenly relaxing it is to get all of that out of your head.
