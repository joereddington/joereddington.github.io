title: "Migrated and updated the maps of books" 
--- 

I've been doing some migration work: various ancient bits of code are being cleaned up and made presentable for the blog. 

The most notable recent one is that I've moved my [maps of books](/narrativemaps.html) to this site and, in the process, cleaned it up and added a separate repo for sa Pride and Prejudice visualisation that I thought was long lost.  

It's interested to have reached the stage in my life where I can look back on things I did a decade ago and feel proud of them.
