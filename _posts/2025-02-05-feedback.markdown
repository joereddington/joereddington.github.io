Quick teaching thing. Last term I started I practice I will keep doing which was that I collected up any negative feedback I received along with the action I took in response. I put each example into a Microsoft form and gave it to the students during a break in a lecture.

You can see an example of the form itself [here](https://forms.office.com/e/K6YGkt7KE6) and it looks like this:

There are two reasons for this: 

1. I genuinely would like to know if any actions I take are sufficient.  
2. It sends a clear message to the students that their feedback is considered, understood, and acted upon.
