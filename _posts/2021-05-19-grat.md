* Things I'm grateful for. 
* Childcare, both because Nova gets to see her friends, but also because I can be grateful in a clear tidy house after getting a lot of work done.  
* Taking Leo into town.  Lots of big eyes Looking At All The Things.  
* Being in a bookshop.  With books. 
* Cups of tea that I didn't ask for. 
* How naturally and beutifully Nova makes friends at any availible playground. 
* Planning and playing and sketching ideas out on notebooks. 
* Leo falling into a box like a cartoon. 
* Frying pan cookie. 
* Excitement and happiness.
