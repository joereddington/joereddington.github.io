This week I am grateful for this boy.  Who laughs loudly and plays and grabs and is glorious. 

I'm grateful for resting quietly. For messages from old friends, for books that I don't like but that make me think anyway. 

I'm grateful for both winning and losing, and jokes about silly things. I'm grateful for sleeping babies whom I am letting lie. I'm grateful for excellent films and terrible films, for phone calls from mum and for meeting lots of interesting new people this week. 

I'm grateful for running, for plans for climbing tomorrow, for cookery and giggling and late night chats and (very small) road trips.
