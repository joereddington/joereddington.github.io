I'm not going to your event: I don't accept invitations to all male spaces, including meetings, calls, trips, panels, stages, and parties. 

In general, if there are more than four people, and none of them are women, then I'm not going unless the men are part of a group that is systemically biased against. So I'll happily attend a gay book club, or the GB mens wheelchair basketball annual dinner.
