I've been sad, overwhelmed really.  A big sign of that is that I've only managed one Gratitude post since Valentine's Day. Today is a good day so I'm making hay while the sun shines.  

What am I grateful for this week? 

* That Eleanor let me crawl all over her boat while asking increasingly nerdy questions. 
* How excited Leo was to see the aforementioned boat. 
* That Mum and Aunt Sheila visited and got to spend an evening and a morning playing with the kids. 
* Nice calls with colleagues
* Cool new Standing desk (dancing while working)   
* Getting to grips with my coursework marking. 
* Fan mail for my book! I have read it out to Kat several times. I am likely to do so again. 
* Successfully rescuing our yeast starter. 
* Lots of food from neighbours 
* Library visits with the kids 
* Nova's trip to Smyths toys (she was very excited) 
* Successfully hacking together a remote control blind with a hammer, vice, and Vaseline. 
* The possibility that the mechanics have fixed the leak in the car. 

I'm excited for Nova's extremely late birthday party this weekend, the end of university term (so I can give a decent amount of attention to my other jobs) and Nova's 50th Parkrun this weekend.
