title:      Paper reading - Layers of Silence
---

I read ["Layers of Silence, Arenas of Voice: The Ecology of Visible and Invisible Work"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1008651105359)(Sadly paywalled) for a paper reading group recently and found it one of the better papers I've read in years (I was sending screenshots to my partner as I read it). 

Some notes, mostly for my own interest. 

* I hadn't heard of 'articulation work' before and I think that's a much better formulation of a thing that a lot of sources call 'leadership'. 
* It quotes heavily from [this book about race](https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=3O5YhD-PCY8C&oi=fnd&pg=PA5&ots=dMwjjjNbvw&sig=KSCuDKW2JV-G6LC3jtUYKRMPRCo&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false), which I've added to my to-read list. 
* It's nicely written
* It's old (it predates youTube), which makes it easy to see how right it was at the time.
