One of the first recipes in my [Science and Cooking](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0393634922/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) book is [Joanne Chang's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanne_Chang) Almond Pralines.  

It has literally three ingredients: water, sugar, and almonds:

This is what it's meant to look like:

This is what my first attempt looked like:

The problems were: 

* Being a bit scared of ruining the pan by overcooking the sugar (I'm told this isn't a thing) and so taking it off early. 
* Ignoring the 'don't stir' instruction because of panic and stirring it a lot (the stirring creates 'nucleation' points for the crystals to form. 

The second attempt (with a bit more bravery and much less stirring looked like this:

I'm extremely happy with how it came out (although I do think I let the sugar go a little too far).  

It was a nice exercise to get me comfortable with the idea of doing the wide range of things that one does with sugar-water-boil and I'm looking forward to doing more like it. 

It was blitzed in the blender and I used it as a topping for my home made ice-cream.
