<p>Very late post…*</p>
<p>In 2017 I did some consulting for the Royal Society of Chemistry on the topic of disabilty.&nbsp; While looking for something else today I found that the research is publicly online and you can see it <a href="https://edu.rsc.org/resources/accessibility-awareness/2240.article">on the RSC’s website</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; I very much enjoyed the work (particularly as it came while I wasn’t getting a salary while working on <a href="http://equalitytime.co.uk/">eQuality Time</a>), and I like to think it’s a good read for anyone thinking of online resources, education, or online resources in education.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fitting in the odd bit of private research does help pay the morgage so if you happen to know anyone who has a budget and a question, feel free to point them my way.</p>
