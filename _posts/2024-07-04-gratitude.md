This week's gratitude  - it's been {{ weeks_since_start }} weeks since I started doing these. 

I'm grateful for seeing Francesca and Yvonne in the flesh! Oreos with the kids, unexpected picnics in the park, family swimming, adventurous bike rides, an extremely good Flowers For Turing (thank you mum and dad for doing the legwork, days out in London with Kat, DIY days with Leo, BBQs, parties (thank you Liz for inviting us), giving blood,  a fancy new vacume cleaner, nice feedback from camps, a lovely meeting with Clare H, a talk that went really well (Thank you to all well (thank you to all the ISG folk who turned up to support and to the audience that really got into the spirit of things).  I also loved family meals, all the lovely pictures that the kids bring home and occasional moments of peace.
