I have been taking some photos of planets. 

This is Jupiter at a distance of about 800 million km.

This is Mars:

Taken with my Nikon D7000 via a T-mount and [this telescope](https://www.darkskytelescopehire.co.uk/telescopes-for-hire/200mm-revelation-dobsonian-reflector-telescope) that I hired from the excellent Dark Sky Telescope Hire (It seems also be called a Classic 200P Dobsonian). 

I've learned quite a lot about telescopes and the movements of planets (and that the ISS is very fast) from this adventure. 

On the other hand I've also found it quite frustrating. Like a child, I expect any old telescope to let me see another planet filling the whole of my view like this:

...whereas the reality is a little more disappointing. I find myself wondering what sort of telescope Galileo was using in 1610 when he identified four distinct moons of Jupiter. I'll need to do some investigating of [sites like this](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/how-to-see-jupiters-moons/) 

This is, of course, all done accompanied by my little stargazer.
