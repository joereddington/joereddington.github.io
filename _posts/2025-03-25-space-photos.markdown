I have been taking some photos of planets. 

This is Jupiter at a distance of about 800 million km.

This is Mars:

Taken with my Nikon D7000 via a T-mount and [this telescope](https://www.darkskytelescopehire.co.uk/telescopes-for-hire/200mm-revelation-dobsonian-reflector-telescope) that I hired from the excellent Dark Sky Telescope Hire (It seems also be called a Classic 200P Dobsonian). 

I've learned quite a lot about telescopes from the adventure. Also about how planets work (and that the ISS is very fast)
