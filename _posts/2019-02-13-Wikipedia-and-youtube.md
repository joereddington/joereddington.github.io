I’ve been working on Wikipedia. I find it calming.

I’m making a video of each editing session because it feels cool, and because having a “only edit on video” rule stops me ‘checking’ my watchlish twenty times a day.  It’s also nice to be able to look back at them to say “Why *did *I make that change?”.

I’ve set up a separate YouTube Channel for the videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4DUmGMOWnrf4VH3kLw6P2A?disable_polymer=true), there’s about 20 videos there.
