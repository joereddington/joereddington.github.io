Thank you to the little elf that babysat so that Kat and I could go out for dinner and thank you to the excellent staff at 50nine for excellent food.   I'd like to thank the students I've been meeting with this week for being interesting and engaging.  Thank you to people who took the lead arranging leaving gifts (not for us).  

I'm grateful when people send me recommendations for good TV, when the kids are gorgeous together. 

Thank you to everybody who donated to Flowers For Turing, and everybody who helped make it happen.  I'm grateful for invitations and air-conditioning and the occasional few minutes to chat to people.   

Thank you to Kat who moved lots of things around so that I could take a trip back to Scarsbrick - I had a lovely few days seeing Richard and doing various odd jobs for mum and dad. 

I did some work on my book! I was super pleased with myself for that. I've been ignoring it for months and it's now about ten pages longer

I'm grateful for playing chess with Nova, for the first BBQ of the season and for really good swimming from Leo.
