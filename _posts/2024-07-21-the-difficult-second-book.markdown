I apparently forgot to put anything about it on my blog but last summer I started writing a second memory book.  

It has the title of "Memorising Physics constants" and is on the topic of memorising physics constants (I am very creative when it comes to titles).  


The plan was to get it done by Christmas 2023 (because I was starting an extra job as a Lecturer at that time).  It didn't get finished and a combination of some grumpiness about how the community worked and my much increased workload put it on the back burner.  

My partner reminded me about it in the context of a summer project and I've decided to open it up to see what state it was in.   
Here's what I found: 

Here are the last entries on the spreadsheet were I was tracking my writing: 

| Date    | Wordcount | +/-    |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| 12/1/24 | 9721      |        |
| 13/1/24 | 11522     | 1801   |
| 14/1/24 | 11757     | 235    |
| 11/4/24 | 19433     | 7676   |
| 12/4/24 | 21692     | 2259   |
| 16/4/24 | 22695     | 1003   |

It turns out that my memory is inaccurate - I thought I hadn't worked on it since Christmas, but I had short bursts in January and April. 

For what it's worth - those 22,000 words come to about 161 pages in the current pdf. 

I spent a couple of hours on it today, mostly spring cleaning and remembering where I was up to. 

* I've got it compiling again. 
* I've updated the makefile so it's faster to work on. 
* I've refreshed my memory of where I was in the writing process. 
* URL's now wrap a little better and I've redefined some commands. 

I don't know if I'm going to push on it. I'm certainly feeling quite burned out at the moment, but it's pleasant to imagine a world where this is done...
