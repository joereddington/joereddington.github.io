This week's gratitude  - it's been {{ weeks_since_start }} weeks since I started doing these. 

I'm grateful for curling up with my favourite human in front of a wood fire while it's cold outside.  I'm thankful for giving blood, Leo's gentle chatting, Nova's fierceness,  and Biscoff biscuits.  

This week I loved that Leo told a friend 'you look like a princess' that Nova can't get through a page of our reading without asking four different questions, and that Kat beats me at the advert game every time.    

I'm grateful for fairly good weather, catching up with old friends, focused time on projects and that I finally finished the politics book I was reading.
