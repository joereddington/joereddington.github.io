It's an interesting list -- [Frida Kahlo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frida_Kahlo) was a painter who happened to have one leg. [Barbara Gordon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Gordon) is interesting, because, of course, she's fictional (the former Batgirl).  But we're also missing such ones as **Roosevelt**, **Lord Nelson**, and **Ludwig van Beethoven**. I suspect it's actually that their articles haven't been tagged by Wikipedia as being disability-related. 

I think it is interesting to maintain (the first version of this article is from 2013) and it's also interesting to distinguish between 'people whose fame is tied to a disability' and 'people who are famously disabled' and finally 'people whose disability isn't in the first five facts you know about them'.
