A weekly list of things I'm grateful for - it's been {{ weeks_since_start }} weeks since I started doing these. 

We've been on holiday this last week. I'm grateful that we: 

* got to see a lot of Kat's family on the journey. 
* had a cool wagon for carrying all our stuff (and indeed, my children) to and from the beach. 
* saw how happy leo was to go and get holiday chippy-chips with me. 
* played 'throw the hoops on the stick' with Nova 
* made a beach shelter out of driftwood
