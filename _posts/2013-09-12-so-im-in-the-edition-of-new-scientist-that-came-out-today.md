SoÂ I&#8217;m in the edition of New Scientist that came out today(there&#8217;s an online versionÂ [here](http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21929344.500-automatic-style-spotter-can-spot-your-next-book.html#.UjStYGR4aJc))

I have to say, that having seen some awful science reporting over the years I&#8217;d somewhat braced myself for the worst, but actually the reporter who interviewed me has accurately quoted me as much as possible and where I said something ill-judged, he recognised it was ill-judged and didn&#8217;t use it in the article. I&#8217;m prepared to call it a fairly positive journalism experience.

Something I do have to address &#8211; because of the length requirements that the article was written under, it&#8217;s possible to take the impression that I&#8217;m running some sort of team and that I&#8217;m being the point person. That&#8217;s no true at all and the main reason for the post is that I want to make sure that credit is going in the right direction.

The piece was rewritten on the back of [this paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.3745), which had just been accepted ðŸ™‚Â Â and the interviewer contacted me because I happened to have been the corresponding author on the paper. Â  In fact, the intellectual powerhouse behind the analysis is [Fionn Murtagh](http://www.cs.rhul.ac.uk/home/fionn/), who was formerly my Head of Department at Royal Holloway, and its analysis refined from his earlier work with [Adam Ganz](http://pure.rhul.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/adam-ganz(55937d7c-9684-41f8-9a7f-680f94bd13b1).html). Â In addition to Fionn providing most of the Computer Science expertise, we had [Doug Cowie](http://douglascowie.com/), a Lecturer in our English Department who provides the deep understanding of narrative that forms the whole gestalt of the work. Â As it happens my contribution to the effort was little more than having [a small project that could be used as a testing ground](http://joereddington.com/project-toomanycooks/ "Project TooManyCooks")Â and seeing how the process worked on content that was changing rapidly.
