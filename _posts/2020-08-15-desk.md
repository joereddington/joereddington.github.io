My big project for the day was to rearranged my office. I've moved in front of the window so I get better lighting for video calls, freed up some space and, most importantly, got myself back into a `working' mode.

Some notes: 

* The cheapskate's water cooler on the right turned out to be an excellent idea 
* The mouse is on a cord because that helps me use the phone less (the phone is locked in drawer and the key is on the end of the mouse cable; that's probably another post)
* The Powerline adapter is to solve a persisent problem with my wifi - the router is no more than two meters away but my desk machine has a great deal of problems connecting to it. 

The long term plan is to convert the room into an office/grown-up room. We've ceeded control of the rest of the house to the children so it would be nice to put a sofa and movie projector in here for 'date night': the combination of a newborn and lockdown does suggest that it's worth planning for indoor dates.  

Short term plans/ideas include: 
* Clearing out all the junk that's outside the frame of the photo 
* Putting a larger top onto the filing cabinate so it can be used as a table. 
* A better desk chair.
* A set of speakers. 
* Automated (or at least remote control) blinds
