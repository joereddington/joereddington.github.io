title: Private in Public now available as a Chrome Extension
---

A few months ago I did a weekend project (Private In Public) making a tool that let you encrypt very short bits of text in a single web page. You can read about it a bit more [here](http://joereddington.com/6374/2017/02/13/private-in-public-a-weekend-project./).

It is now available as a (very early beta) Chrome Extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/private-in-public/nkkibnncmibldhhpgekhhaonhakgnilk). Anyone who is interested in hiding things ยงe:U2FsdGVkX1/XEh72t/QGzIROohr6hRnTVqwYyxhSbQ4=ยง might find it cool, and I'd be really interested in your comments.

For more details on the code: please see [this](https://github.com/joereddington/PrivateInPublic/) GitHub page, and for more information on the process I took to make it into a Chrome Extension, please see [this live process log.](https://github.com/joereddington/PrivateInPublic/issues/13) 

I've got some plans for things I want to use it for, but I like the idea that it might be useful more generally.
