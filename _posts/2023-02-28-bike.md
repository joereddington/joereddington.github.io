title: "Exercise bike setup" 
--- 

This is sort of a collection of photos but... 

My mental health very much suffers if I'm not exercising every day. It's a particularly bad sign if I get out of the habit. 

At Christmas I upgraded my smartwatch - that let me use a new app.

The new app (Pulsalarm) sets off an alarm if my heart rate drops out of the zone I'm looking for.  This in turn means that I can start listening/doing much more distracting things while working out on my exercise bike. 

The rest of this post is the evolution of my setup over the 60 days or so since I've been using this. 

The first version was borrowing Leo's iPad to watch TV while cycling.

Then I tried balancing my old ps3 on a shelf and buying a audio splitter for about £10 to pipe the audio direct to my headphones.

Then I put together something slightly more study.

When it became apparent that this was a habit that was sticking (after I'd played through the whole of Uncharted 3, and started Uncharted 2). I built a more permanent and compact version out of scrap wood in the garage.  If you look closely you can see these photos accidentally also document our winter 'tidy the garage' project.

Future plans include:  
* saving up for a PS4 (I'm aware that I'm a good 15 years behind in console gaming terms and it would be nice to reduce that to only 10), 
* getting a proper 'exercise bike' rather than a turbo trainer  
  * Or even upgrading the actual bike - it was £200 about seven years ago and has been much abused since.
* Possibly getting a running machine (I'd definitely run outside in the summer, but it's nice to watch a film while jogging if it's raining) 
  * This also opens up the possibility of a 'walking desk' for working, but I don't know how much use that would be for anything other than zoom calls which I rarely have.
