title: Today I have...
---


I'm feeling despondent about a number of things so I'm going to be writing down what I get done today. 

✅ Redrafted a book and updated it on Amazon  
✅ Renewed the domain for equalitytime.co.uk
✅ bought Kat a present
✅ Had really useful, if challenging conversation with a mentor
✅ worked out what the plans were for the weekend 
✅ properly thanked my sister for visiting 
✅ signed up to a mailing list (that I suspect I will shortly unsubscribe to) 
✅ Did an enormous amount of training for my RHUL job (including fire safety, which is fun)
