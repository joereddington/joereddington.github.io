Some of my research ([Domesday related](http://joereddington.com/aac-and-the-domesday-dataset/ "AAC and the Domesday Dataset")) appeared in the online press this week &#8211; [Children face postcode lottery for communication aids](http://www.cypnow.co.uk/cyp/news/1077938/children-postcode-lottery-communication-aids) &#8211; In &#8216;Children and Young People Now&#8217; (picture is their own).

> More than five years after the publication of the _Bercow Review_, which first highlighted the inconsistent nature of NHS provision of communication aids across England, analysis of data has discovered &#8220;strong evidence&#8221; that a postcode lottery still exists for children and young people.
  
> The [research](http://www.cs.rhul.ac.uk/home/joseph/domesday.html) by Royal Holloway academic Joseph Reddington found that there was no provision of communication aids for children, young people or adults in a range of NHS regions across the country

The link is now broken, but it was nice while it was there.
