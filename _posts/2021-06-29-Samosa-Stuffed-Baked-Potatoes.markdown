This week I made Samosa Stuffed Baked Potatoes from [The Veganomicon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Veganomicon-10th-Anniversary-Ultimate-Cookbook/dp/0738218995/ref=asc_df_0738218995/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=310882654267&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4703548750355337321&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9046046&hvtargid=pla-418222793438&psc=1&th=1&psc=1).

I quite enjoyed making them, largely because it takes so long to bake potatoes that you have plenty of time to prepare everything else properly, so that it slides in nicely.  Although I did note that I need a lot more of those small bowls that TV chefs use to hold ingredients.

I'm fairly pleased with the final result (even if the children refused to eat it).
