*Note: my food posts are notes for my own interest, this isn't intended to be a cookery blog - particularly because some of the receipies end in disaster*

Today I'm cooking Cauliflower Katsu Curry. I've made seiten Katsu Curry before but that was in a frying pan, this is my first time trying it in an oven. 


Ingrediants
* Large Cauliflower 

* Batter is one half cup flour and one cup soy milk
* No oil in the baking try

TODO: Work out how to put search terms in here



I put this much breaded cauliflower in the baking oven of the aga for 35 minutes

Made the Curry with 600ml and four of the cubes (so, a third of the pack) - it didn't thicken as I'd like so I added a bit of flour and then had to strain it.   Turned out to be slightly too much saurce. 


In generla I think breaded cauliflower didn't work that well, I think the meal needed more colour (wagmmas sever this with brightly coloured salad)
