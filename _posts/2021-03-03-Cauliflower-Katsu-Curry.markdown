Today I'm cooking Cauliflower Katsu Curry. I've made seiten Katsu Curry before but that was in a frying pan, this is my first time trying it in an oven.

## Ingredients
* Cauliflower (amount below)
* Batter (half cup flour and one cup soy milk)
* 2/3rds of a packet of [pre-packaged Katsu curry blocks](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/handle-buy-box/ref=dp_start-bbf_1_glance)
* [pre-packaged Panko Breakcrumbs](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yutaka-Panko-Breadcrumbs-300-Pack/dp/B003TJATIC/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=yutaka+panko&qid=1614843799&sr=8-2)
* one onion. 
* 600 ml of water 


## Notes
* No oil in the baking try
* I battered the cauliflower and then roasted for 35 minutes in the baking oven of the Aga. 40 would have been better. In fact, I think that I would like to try roasting first and then doing the breadcrumbs in the pan 
* 600ml of sauce turns out to be slighly too much for the family. 300 was too little last time. 
* I used this much cauliflower:

In general I think breaded cauliflower didn't work that well: I really want some protein under the breading. Looking at the photo - I definitely wanted some colour, and I should have looked at the internet a bit first to get the idea of plating.  Also a wider aperture because my depth of field is far too small.
