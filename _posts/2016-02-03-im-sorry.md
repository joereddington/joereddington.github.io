title: 'I'm sorry'
---

  A friend passed away recently.

  She was an astonishingly cheerful and nice person. She kept in contact, she followed her dreams and didn’t have an ounce of guile in her.  I moved away and only a little while after I did, she met a guy, married him, started a business, and had a beautiful baby boy.

  About a month ago her Facebook wall started to fill up with tributes.  She had committed suicide.  Post natal depression had hit her like a hammer.  She was the very last person I expected to lose like that. The very last.

  When I started getting sent posts about eating disorders on what was, at the time, my blog. Two friends, one very close, contacted me to say that they spent time in a residential facility for people with eating disorders. I wouldn’t have known. Wouldn’t have even suspected.
