{% assign start_date = '2018-01-01' | date: "%s" %}
{% assign current_date = site.time | date: "%s" %}
{% assign seconds_per_week = 604800 %}
{% assign weeks_since_start = current_date | minus: start_date | divided_by: seconds_per_week %}

A weekly list of things I'm grateful for - it's been {{ weeks_since_start }} weeks since I started doing these (I did miss last week). 

This one is a big longer, particular because it's been ten days but also because I'm trying to review more thoroughly.  

Mostly I'm still staggered by this:

Nova won 1st place overall (and some other medals) at her first ever gymnastics competition. Her category was `5 year olds not in the squad'

But it's been a wonderful time full of cookery dates with Kat, days out with Leo and making lists and ticking them off.
