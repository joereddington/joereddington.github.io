title: "Sad"

---


I am very sad and have been for a while.  Three weeks ago, after I had a particularly bad week,  a trusted friend asked me if I was burnt out and I burst into tears. It hasn't got any better since: I'm constantly exhausted, entirely demotivated and things that used to be very easy are both hard and deeply tiring. 

I have been sad before and I got better, I expect this to be the same. I am doing the things (exercise, daylight, family and friends) that work for me. I am also doing the things that people I trust suggest "Book proper leave; get more sleep". I've gone to the doctor and am having blood tests. 

Also my coping mechanisms are much healthier than they used to be and the kids get easier as they get older so those both mean that I'm still able to pull my weight with the house and the kids. 
The burnout thing is new and it is scary.  I'm a couple of weeks from spending ten years on eQuality Time and everything is suddenly on top of me.  Today I sent a bunch of apologies, and put the out of office on.  I already feel a little less weight.  

I am, still, extraordinarily grateful that I am surrounded by people who have me prioritise my mental health.
