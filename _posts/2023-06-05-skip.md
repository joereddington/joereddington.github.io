I spent a couple of evenings restoring this battery powered ride on car the other week and I'm really pleased with it.  

I found it originally in a skip:

...and I thought 'Leo would love that'.  The house was being renovated but I put a note through the door with my contact details in case it was a problem (The legality of getting things out of skips is [oddly complex](https://www.aasvogel.co.uk/uk-dumpster-diving-is-it-illegal-to-go-through-a-skip/) so I'm definitely of the 'ask permission' persuasion)  

I successfully (it was a tight fit) got it in the back of the car and spend a few evenings tracing wires around the inside to work out what was going on.  I bought a 12V battery from Amazon, fixed a couple of wires that weren't were they should have been and magically the thing started working!  I gave it a thorough clean and made a replacement seat and bonnet out of some MDF - helpfully I had a matching charging adapter in my projects bin. 

Both kids have been using it to tear up the garden over the last few weeks. I'm really pleased with it as a little project (even if I did end up spending about the same in time and parts as I probably would have done buying it new.
