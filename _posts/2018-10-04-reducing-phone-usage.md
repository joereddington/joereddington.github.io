I periodically run small accountability projects on Facebook &#8211; a recent one was about phone usage.

I started using the (buggy) early release version of iOS 12 because I was really interested in the ‘screen time’ feature. After a week of trying to use my phone ‘naturally’ I was pretty shamed by amount of time I spent glued to my device. (Picking it up 100 times a day is amazing)

The accountability bit was: I’m planning on posting the results once a week until they either improve, or I stop being embarrassed by them.

The final results were (with links to the facebook posts:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Week</strong>
    </td>
    
    <td>
      <strong>hours and minutes per day</strong>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      Week 1
    </td>
    
    <td>

  </tr>

      <a href="https://www.facebook.com/joe.reddington/posts/10100780139957080">1:29</a> (Mostly due to having lots of guests stay over so there wasn&#8217;t time  to play on phone)

      Week 5

They started pretty appallingly (I was amazed), but got rapidly better at week 6. At the time I wrote:

> I had a proper think and realised that, while in the house, my phone is almost always the second best device to use (I got myself a nice camera recently, all my notifications go through to my watch and are actually best dealt with on a laptop). So I may as well only use it when I&#8217;m out of the house.
> 
> So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been doing &#8211; the phone has been charging by the door and I&#8217;ve only picked it up when leaving the house.

And I was able to mostly keep to that.    Overall it was a successful experiment, a dramatic difference, and I&#8217;m pleased.

_EDIT, in the years since my phone usage has waxed and waned but remains reasonably low - it's normally quite a good indicator of my mental health as much as anything_
