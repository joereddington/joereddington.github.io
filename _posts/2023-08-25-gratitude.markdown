A weekly list of things I'm grateful for - it's been {{ weeks_since_start }} since I started doing these. 

It's been a mixed week - the kids were ill consecutively - nothing like ill enough to be worrying, but ill enough that all plans were canceled and there was a couple of days that involved sitting on the sofa watching TV all day.  

I'm grateful that they are both all recovered, that I managed to give Leo an excellent haircut, that I got to see some of my guidechildren this weekend.  

A big thank you to everybody who has been on the other end of a phone/email recently. I owe some of you replies - you can take comfort from the fact that the more touching I found your message the longer it takes to do it justice. 


I'm thankful for the little things: Nova being excited to get a book out of the library, Leo starting the dishwasher, the kids walking hand in hand.  Also that I have a new project I'm willing to be a little bit excited about and that I finally finished the Wolf Hall Trilogy. 

Thank you to H for being an excellent soft-play buddy,
