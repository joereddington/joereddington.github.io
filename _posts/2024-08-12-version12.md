About eight months ago I [published the Kindle Version](https://joereddington.com/2023/12/07/i-m-producing-the-kindle-version-of-advanced-memory-palaces.html) of [Advanced Memory Palaces](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Advanced-Memory-Palaces-second-should/dp/B09GJFZ6JM/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) 

When doing this I had to do quite a lot of modifications to the LaTeX to get it to work correctly as an epub. The paperback version and the Kindle version got separated and as a result I haven't put up any updates since launch.  

This week I finally sat down and produced a LaTeX file that worked for both pdf and epub and have updated Amazon's severs. In the process I fixed uncomfortable number of typos.
