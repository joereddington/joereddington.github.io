A weekly list of things I'm grateful for - it's been {{ weeks_since_start }} weeks since I started doing these. 


I don't want to write a gratitude today.  I'm grumpy, tired and generally fed up.  

For at least the last week I've been in full ‘negative vision’ mode. I find fault with everything I see. It’s a superpower when it’s controlled and harnessed but when it drowns out all other voices it’s a great way of ruining things. 

So, what can I think of to be grateful for?  Let me go through my photos since the 20 February...  

* Leo and I had a bunch of fun days out during half-term
* I got to use RHUL's wonderful library collection to pull out some texts for my next memory book. 
* Richard came to stay for two nights! We went to the Centre for Computing History and it was great.  
* Leo had his first go on a PS4 
* I found the missing set of house keys
* Leo is starting to get used to their bike
* Nova and I made caramel popcorn 
* I ran a half marathon and then got to go to a lovely birthday celebration. 
* I gave blood. 

Now, these are moments, not gratitudes. The gratitude is: I'm grateful that I time to spend with the kids, that I was healthy enough to give blood and fit enough to run a long way.  I'm grateful that I have friends that think of me.
