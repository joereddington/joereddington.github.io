A few months ago I had an ambition to read 10,000 pages before the end of the year. I've now done it. Here are the books. I like doing counting pages rather than books because I'd rather not be incentivised to read 'little' books.  There's some comfort reading in here (Fifth Elephant), quite a lot of 'turn your brain off' books, but also some that I wouldn't have tried before like White Tiger, and the Hilary Mantel books (and indeed, A Memory Called Empire). 

I'd like to read more next year (I only started this around the summer), but it's actually more true to say I'd like to be doing less of the rubbish that I do instead of reading: scrolling, faffing, boredly eating.
