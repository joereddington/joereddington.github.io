[The piece in New Scientist](/2013/09/12/so-im-in-the-edition-of-new-scientist-that-came-out-today/ "So I’m in the edition of New Scientist that came out today…") the other day generated a couple of follow ups and I think it's worth giving some notes on the process (for example my co-authors and I weren't contacted by either of the below publications).

[The Altantic Wire](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2013/09/will-science-find-next-twilight/69496/) did a really nice job - they'd clearly read and understood the paper, they used a graphic that was in the paper, gave a high level explanation of it and recycled some quotes from another article in a reasonable way. I think it's a nice example of science reporting - someone reads the paper and then writes about it.

Separately - I found that [this Russian News site](http://compulenta.computerra.ru/chelovek/culture/10009017/) was driving a lot of traffic to my academic url - and a helpful colleague was able to tell me that it was a (reasonably) direct and fairly flattering translation of the original New Scientist piece.
