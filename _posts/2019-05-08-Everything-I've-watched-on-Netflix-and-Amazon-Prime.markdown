title:      Everything I've watched on Netflix and Amazon Prime
---

I’ve previously written [Everything I watched on TV in 2016](http://joereddington.com/6316/2017/01/03/2016tv/), and [Everything I’ve watched so far in 2017](http://joereddington.com/6454/2017/11/14/everything-ive-watched-so-far-in-2017/).  It’s been a while and it’s worth coming back to.

Some tips:

*   To find out what you watched on Netflix the address is: [https://www.netflix.com/viewingactivity](https://www.netflix.com/viewingactivity).
*   To find out what you watched on Amazon Prime, you want: [this link][https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/yourstore/iyr/ref=atv_unknown?ie=UTF8&collection=watched] which is much more complex to get data out of. 

Couple of notes:

*   This is the first post on TV-watching since having a baby girl.  There’s a lot of Peppa Pig now in the stream.  That’s also how I found out that Amazon only counts the most recent watching of a program – we’ve watched Frozen daily since Nova was about six months old and Amazon is convinced we’ve only seen it once.
*   I’ve taken the information from the end of the last post on the topic (that was September 2017, so this is an 18 month period).
*   Both Amazon and Netflix include programs you clicked on accidentally or watched five minutes of, so I am unable to comment on the content of ‘Bleeding Steel’.  This turns out to be about 20% of the list.
*   As before I’ve removed programs watched by my partner from Amazon Prime.
*   Netflix and Amazon handle series’s differently: Amazon will tell you you watched a series (even if you only watched an episode, whereas Netflix will give you every episode as a separate line)

Things I’ve learned:

*   I don’t think that I watch much TV, but I’ve watched a surprisingly large amount in the last 18months,  Certainly there’s enough for an episode of TV every two days or so and the occasional binge: that’s a lot more than I would have said.
*   My partner watches quite a lot of TV without me.
*   I cannot justify Netflix spending for my usage, but the rest of my family push it up into ‘mildly economical’.
