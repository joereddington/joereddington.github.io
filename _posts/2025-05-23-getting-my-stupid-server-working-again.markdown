This is a stream-of-conciousness set of notes for next time I have to do this job. Completely lacking interest to anyone unless you are googling the exact same errors I had...  

The website and IMPS writing platform for White Water Writers (https://www.whitewaterwriters.com/) is hosted on an EC2 instance.

To save money over the winter I paused the instance and switched the website over to Github Pages. I now need to get it up and running again for a camp next week.  

I rebooted the EC2 instance and  edited the A record in Route 53 to point to the correct IP address (13.40.0.39) and removed the CNAME record that github wanted.  I can now ssh into the server with `ssh www' rather than the more complex 



```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/Webserver1-keypair.pem ec2-user@13.40.0.39
```

The nginx server is running: 

```
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-26-130 ~]$ sudo systemctl status nginx

```

...but it is not showing me a website at https://whitewaterwriters.com

I have done some checking: 

```

```
and on the server: 


```
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-26-130 ~]$ sudo grep -r 'white' /etc/nginx/
/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:  return 301 https://whitewaterwriters.com$request_uri;
/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:        server_name  www.whitewaterwriters.com;
/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.whitewaterwriters.com/fullchain.pem;
/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.whitewaterwriters.com/privkey.pem;
/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:  return 301 https://whitewaterwriters.com$request_uri;

/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:        root /usr/share/nginx/html/whitewaterwriters-site/_site/;
```

Okay, it turned out that the answer was: 

"You need to create a cname from www.whitewaterwriters.com to whitewaterwriters.com" 

...which is fine. 

Okay, the site is up and running. Great.  However, Etherpad seems really slow.  I investigate and python is using a lot of resources: 

```
ps -eo pid,comm,user,%cpu,%mem,cmd --sort=-%cpu | grep python
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-26-130 ~]$ ps -eo pid,comm,user,%cpu,%mem,cmd --sort=-%cpu | grep python

```

In particuarly the updating of books is a problem. 

I kill those proceses and update manually.  Update_books.py does indeed take a long time. Currently (I've never needed to optimise for time before) whenever it updates a book it loads a database containing _every single previous book_ into memory, updates a book, and then saves it again.  It does that process for every book in the 'current books' list and it runs through the current books list every five minutes. 

I fixed the more obvious problems with that and commited the code (on production, which I'm a little worried about) 



  After I put in some print statements (I should have profiled properly but now isn't the time) I discover that there is a big delay opening the 'books.json' database.  Part of the problem appeared to be the 6.0M books.json file (I feel like that is too small to cause a problem but I should probably check the code.
