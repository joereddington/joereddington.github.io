title: "Backup Notes"
---

I am a big believer in '[Finder Zero](https://joereddington.com/2021/01/28/Finder-Zero-You-use-far-fewer-files-than-you-think,-so-stop-hoarding-them.html)', but I also believe in backing things up. So I regularly backup things like RAW files for Photography, disk images from servers, and archives from long forgotten projects. 

In general, backing them up _to_ my desktop is enough. That's the backup. 
Indeed. I actually use these files so little that I need to remember to mount the disk before using it with 


     sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1p1 bigdisk/ 

Normally after I've had to find the disk with ```lsblk```.  

Every few months I back up that drive to a big external drive with one of: 

    rsync -aHAXv --exclude=lost+found --info=progress2 --ignore-existing /home/joe/bigdisk/ /media/joe/1TB\ externa/bigdisk/ #(when I want super fast) 
    rsync -aHAXv --exclude=lost+found --info=progress2 --size-only /home/joe/bigdisk/ /media/joe/1TB\ externa/bigdisk/ # (when I think I might have edited the archive a bit) 


...and store it securely.  About once I year I take that external drive to a secure external site and back it up there.
