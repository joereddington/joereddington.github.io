I'm grateful for peaceful mornings, lie-ins, teaching Nova how to do forward rolls, Leo falling asleep on me, early nights, confort food books, Meg Hill's red group, peanuts, film afternoons with Leo, fun meetings with famous people, notebooks, flaws, sleep, putting (well, starting to) a birdhouse with Nova, playing little work games, and getting to the bottom of problems.
