This week's gratitude  - it's been {{ weeks_since_start }} weeks since I started doing these. 

It’s been a second brutal week. Nova followed the other two into illness, but with much more vomiting although they pulled through in 48 hours.  

So: positives… 

First of all I’m so happy that everybody is back to full strength and is at work/school/gymnastics.  It’s nice to have anyone semi-conscious on the sofa. 

I’n super thankful I’m in a great team at work: this week people variously sent messages of support, worked the weekend so my students got their marks on time, dropped everything for me to spend an hour ranting on a Friday afternoon and the, like, six, people who moved lots of things around so I could stay home on Monday and look after everybody. 

I’m grateful that Leo nailed their nativity performance (they played ‘king with a vague idea of the words’) and that we could swap tickets so that both Kat and I could see it.  

I’m thankful that the car was “a little bit broken” rather than “completed messed up”
