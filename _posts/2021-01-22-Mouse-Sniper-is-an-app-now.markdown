I [recently wrote]({% post_url 2020-12-26-mouse-sniper %}) about Mouse Sniper, a small python script I built over Christmas. Today I took the time to turn it into a proper mac Application, and these are my notes on how it was done. 

The github branch and commit I used was [this one](https://github.com/joereddington/Mouse-Sniper/commit/4cf0d89333bbc9b4ed5ca429781e08e684564455) and I used the library py2app to perform the conversion.  The documentation for that library confused me, and I got a lot more out of [this blog](http://www.marinamele.com/from-a-python-script-to-a-portable-mac-application-with-py2app) and a number of Stack Exchange threads. 

It's something I've never done before, and reveals me as a seriously under experienced programmer, but it's also something that was fun to learn about.
