title:  "ERIC 2019"
--- 


I volunteered as a photographer for [ERIC2019](http://ericuk.org/) (an escape room industry conference); this was both to stretch myself  as a photographer and because I thought it would be an interesting event.

Things I need to improve…

*     “Getting in the way” – I keep missing shots because I’m not pushy enough to get in the right place.
*     Packing – I’m fairly certain I ran out of batteries while I was there, it’s a while back so I don’t entirely remember.
*     Just take more pictures
*     Advertise in advance – Contact all the presenters – or have some text to pass on to them.
