![Joe Reddington in the Welsh Mountains](assets/images/profile.png)


I’m Joe.

I used to [research](http://joereddington.com/researchpublications/) theoretical computer science. In 2014 I left and founded the charity [eQuality Time](http://equalitytime.co.uk/).  This site contains nearly [400 posts](http://joereddington.com/all-posts/) going back to 2013.  Posts about disability were cleaned up and moved to eQuality Time; remaining topics range from building webapps to [choosing colours for baby blankets](http://joereddington.com/5472/2015/11/04/its-not-baby-boy-blue.-its-sirius./).

Occasionally either me or my work [appears in the press](http://joereddington.com/media/) and I can be contacted on [joe@joereddington.com](mailto:joe@joereddington.com). I am active on most social media, but the best place to find out what I’m working on and thinking about is [my Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/joe.reddington) where I do a lot of talking about projects and designs before they make it here.
