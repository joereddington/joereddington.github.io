I love this picture:

It's the result of some general playing with [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) (which I use for streaming) and connecting it up to Zoom, which is what we've all started using since the lockdown started.

It required a few steps. 

### Step 1: Sort out a small greenscreen (This is literally some green card and a cheap frame from amazon)

### Step 2: have OBS recognise it as a greenscreen. 
This was quite a learning experience. I added a chroma key filter in OBS and then _faffed_ until I could get it to work. I should have spent more time on it. I have to adjust these numbers if the light level changes.

I took a quick picture of myself on the webcam and then transformed it so that it fit the shape of the frame (the frame isn't at exactly 90 degrees to the webcam, so it looks odd without the transformation).
